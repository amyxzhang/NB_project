0	2		Electricity is a familiar term-outlets, batteries, light bulbs, computers all involve electricity.
0	2		It is no understatement to say that modern life depends on electricity, but what exactly is electricity?
0	2		We all know what electricity does, but it's not that easy to explain what elec-tricity is.
0	2		Electricity manifests itself in many ways: from the sparks that fly when you scuff your feet across a carpet on a dry winter day to the electricity we use in our homes to the transmission of radio and television programs.
0	2		Even the attraction between magnets has to do with electricity.
0	2		In this chapter, we begin our treatment of electricity with a discussion of static electricity. 
1	2	H1	22.1 Static electricity 
0	2		When you tear off some plastic wrap from its roll, the wrap is attracted to anything that gets close: your hand, the countertop, a dish.
0	2		This interaction between the plastic wrap and other objects doesn't have to involve any physical contact.
1	2		For example, you can feel the presence of a piece of freshly torn-off plastic wrap with your cheek or the back of your hand even when your face or hand is held some distance away from the piece.
0	2		You may have experienced many similar interactions: Styrofoam peanuts are attracted to your arms when you unpack a box full of them (Figure 22.1).
0	2		Running a comb through your hair on a dry day causes the comb to attract your hair.
0	2		After rubbing a balloon against a woolen sweater, you can hold the balloon close to a wall and see the attraction as the balloon moves toward the wall.
0	2		In all these instances, the mass of the objects is too small for the interactions to be gravitational.
0	2		What, then, is this interaction?
0	2		You may never have thought of these interactions as being particularly strong, but consider this: If you rub a comb through your hair and then pass the comb over some small bits of paper, the bits of paper jump up to your comb and stick to it.
1	2		In other words, the bits of paper accelerate upward, which means the force exerted by your comb on them must be greater than the gravitational force exerted on them by Earth!
1	2		Now try this: Quickly pull a 20-cm strip of transparent tape* out of a dispenser and suspend it from the edge of a CONCEPTS table (just be sure the table is not metal).
1	2		Notice how the tape is attracted to anything brought nearby.
1	2		It might even take some practice to prevent the tape from curling up and sticking to the underside of the table or to your hand.
0	2		Bring a few objects near the suspended tape and notice the attractive interaction between them.
0	2		Go ahead-experiment! 
2	2	SM	22.1 Suspend a freshly pulled piece of transparent tape from the edge of your desk.
2	2	SM	(a) What happens when you hold a battery near the tape?
2	2	SM	Does it matter whether you point the +side or the side of the battery toward the tape?
2	2	SM	Does a spent battery yield a different result?
2	2	SM	Does a wooden object yield a different result?
2	2	SM	(b) What happens when you hold a strip of freshly pulled tape near the power cord of a lamp?
2	2	SM	Does it make any difference if the lamp is on or off? 
0	2		All these interactions involving static electricity are examples of electric interactions.
0	2		The experiment you just did tells you there is no obvious connection between electric interactions and the electricity we think of as "flowing" in electric circuits and batteries.
0	2		In Chapter 31 we shall see, however, that the two are connected.
5	2		Objects that participate in electric interactions exert an electric force on each other.
5	2		The electric force is a field force (see Section 8.3): Objects exerting electric forces on each other need not be physically touching.
0	2		As you may have noticed from the interaction between the strips of tape and various nearby objects, the magnitude of the electric force depends on distance: It decreases as you increase the  separation. 
1	2	SM	22.2  Suspend a freshly pulled strip of transparent tape from the edge of your desk.
1	2	SM	(a) Pull a second strip of tape out of the dispenser and hold it near the first strip.
1	2	SM	What do you notice?
1	2	SM	(b) Does it matter which sides of the strips you orient toward each other? 
0	2		As Checkpoint 22.2 makes clear, not all electric interactions are attractive.
0	2		Even if you increase the mass of the strips by suspending paper clips from them, the repulsion between the strips is great enough to keep the paper clips apart ( Figure 22.2).
0	2		Now place your hand between two repelling strips and notice how both strips fly toward your hand!
0	2		Then run each strip of tape several times between your fingers and notice how the electric interaction diminishes or even disappears. 
1	2	SM	22.3 Suspend two freshly pulled 20-cm strips of transparent tape from the edge of your desk.
1	2	SM	Cut two 20-cm strips of paper, making each strip the same width as the tape, and investigate the interactions between the paper strips and the tape by bringing them near each other.
1	2	SM	Which of the following combinations display an electric interaction: paper-paper, tape-paper, tape-tape?

1	2	H3	Mystified?
1	2	H3	Hang on!

0	3	H3	We'll soon be able to resolve your questions. 
0	3	H1	22.2 Electrical charge 
1	3		As we saw in the preceding section, electric interactions are sometimes attractive and sometimes repulsive.
2	3		In addition, the experiment you performed in Checkpoint 22.3 demonstrates that paper strips, which do not interact electrically with each other, do interact electrically with transparent tape.
2	3		What causes these interactions?
2	3		To answer this question, we need to carry out a systematic sequence of experiments.
0	3		Figure 22.3 illustrates a simple procedure for reproducibly creating strips of tape that interact electrically.
1	3		A  suspended strip created according to this procedure interacts in the following ways: It repels another strip created in the same manner, and it attracts any other object that does not itself interact electrically with other objects (Figure 22.4).
3	3		Let us call the attribute responsible for the electric interaction  electrical charge, or simply charge.
3	3		Saying that something carries an electrical charge is just another way of saying that that object interacts electrically with other objects that carry electrical charge.
1	3		Freshly pulled strips of tape carry electrical charge, and two such strips interact because each possesses an electrical charge, just as your body and Earth interact because each possesses mass.
4	3		The general term for any microscopic object that carries an electrical charge, such as an electron or ion, is charge carrier.
1	3		It is not immediately clear what attributes to assign to objects that do not interact electrically with each other but do interact with a charged tape strip-a strip of paper, your hand, an eraser, you name it.
1	3		All we know for now is that the interaction between these objects and a charged tape is attractive rather than repulsive.
1	3		The electric charge on an object is not a permanent property; if you let a charged strip of tape hang for a while, it loses its ability to interact electrically.
1	3		In other words, the strip is no longer charged-it is discharged.
3	3		Depending on the humidity of the air, the discharging can take minutes or hours, but you can speed up the discharging by rubbing your fingers a few times over the entire length of a suspended charged strip of tape.
2	3		* (The rubbing allows the charge to "leak away" from the tape by distributing itself over your body.)

0	4	SM	Tape strips prepared according to Figure 22.3 repel each other c *If rubbing your fingers along the tape doesn't do the job, try licking them before rubbing them over the tape.
0	4	SM	22.4 (a) Prepare a charged strip of transparent tape as described in Figure 22.3 and then suspend the strip from the edge of your desk.
0	4	SM	Verify that the tape interacts as you would expect with your hand, with a strip of paper, and with another charged strip of tape.
0	4	SM	(b) Rub your fingers along the hanging strip to remove all the charge from it, and then verify that it no longer interacts with your hand.
0	4	SM	If it does interact, rub again until it no longer interacts.
0	4	SM	(c) Predict and then verify experimentally how the uncharged suspended strip interacts with a strip of paper and with a charged strip of tape. 
2	4		To restore the charge on a discharged strip, stick the strip on top of the foundation strip from which you pulled it off (step 1 in Figure 22.3), smooth it out, and then quickly pull it off again.
5	4		You can recharge a strip quite a few times before it loses its adhesive properties.
5	4		Once the tape does lose its adhesiveness, however, recharging it becomes impossible.
1	4		It is generally a good idea to rub your finger over the foundation strip before you reuse it to make sure that it, too, is uncharged. 
0	4	SM	22.5 Recharge the discharged strip from Checkpoint 22.4 and verify that it interacts as before with your hand, with a strip of paper, and with another charged strip of tape. 
1	4		A discharged tape strip interacts in the same way as objects that carry no charge.
1	4		Such objects are said to be electrically  neutral.
1	4		They do not interact electrically with other neutral objects, but they do interact electrically with charged objects.
1	4		We shall examine this surprising fact in more detail in Section 22.4.
1	4		Where does the electrical charge on a charged tape strip come from?
2	4		Is charge created when two strips are pulled apart as in Figure 22.3?
2	4		This is something we can check by sticking two strips of tape together, rubbing with our fingers to remove all charge from the combination, and then quickly separating the two strips (Figure 22.5). 
0	4	SM	22.6  Follow the procedure illustrated in Figure 22.5 to separate a pair of charged strips.
0	4	SM	(a) How does strip B interact with a neutral object?
0	4	SM	How does strip T interact with a neutral object?
0	4	SM	(b) Create a third charged strip and see how it interacts with strip B and with strip T. (c) Is strip T charged?
0	4	SM	(d) Is strip B charged?
0	4	SM	(e) Check what happens to the interactions with B and T strips when you discharge a B or a T strip by rubbing your fingers along its length. 
2	4		As Checkpoint 22.6 shows, separating an uncharged pair of strips produces two charged ones, but the behavior of strip B is different from that of the other strips we have encountered so far! 
0	4	SM	22.7 Make two charged pairs of strips (B and T) following the procedure illustrated in Figure 22.5.
0	4	SM	Investigate the interaction of B with T, T with T, and B with B. 
1	4		The interactions between the B and T strips are illustrated in Figure 22.6: Strips of the same type repel each other, while strips of different types attract each other.
1	4		This series of experiments leads us to conclude that there are two types of charge on the tapes, one type on B strips and another type on T strips.
1	4		Strips that carry the same type of charge, called like charges, exert repulsive forces on each other; strips that carry different types of charge, called opposite charges, exert attractive forces on each other.
0	4		Having determined that two types of electrical charge exist, a logical next question is: Are there even more types? 
0	4	SM	22.8  (a) Prepare one charged strip of tape according to  Figure 22.3 and hang it from the edge of your desk.
0	4	SM	Hang a narrow strip of paper from the desk edge also, about 0.5 m away from the tape strip.
0	4	SM	Pass a plastic comb six times quickly through your hair and then show that the comb is charged.
0	4	SM	Be sure to use a plastic comb; combs made from other materials do not acquire a charge when passed through hair.
0	4	SM	The cheapest type of comb usually works best.
0	4	SM	(b) Make a pair of oppositely charged B and T strips (Figure 22.5) and investigate how they interact with a charged comb.
0	4	FIG	Figure 22.5  Procedure for making strips of transparent tape that carry opposite charges.2 Pull combined T and B strips very slowly o  foundation strip.
0	5		(c) Does your comb behave like a B strip, a T strip, or neither?
0	5		Experiments show that any charged object-obtained by rubbing objects together or otherwise-always attracts either a B strip or a T strip and repels the other.
0	5		No one has ever found a charged object that repels or attracts both types of strips.
5	5		In other words: There are two and only two types of charge.
4	5		Objects that carry like charges repel each other; objects that carry opposite charges attract each other.
3	5		The two types of charge never appear independently of each other: Whenever two neutral objects are either rubbed together and then separated or, if an adhesive surface is involved, stuck together and then separated and one of them acquires a charge of one type, the other object always acquires a charge of the other type.
1	5		The generation of opposite charges is obvious when you separate a neutral pair of tape strips.
1	5		When you pass a comb through your hair, the comb acquires a charge of one type and your hair acquires a charge of the other type.
1	5		On a dry day, you may have noticed that some hair strands stand up away from your head.
1	5		Each charged strand is being repelled by the other charged strands, and so they are all getting as far away from one another as possible.
2	5		It can be shown that when two tape strips are separated, the forces exerted by the B strip and the T strip on a third charged strip are equal in magnitude, although one is attractive and the other repulsive.
2	5		Furthermore, when the B and T strips are recombined, the combination is neutral again.
1	5		These observations suggest that after you rub and then separate a pair of objects, the objects carry equal amounts of opposite charge.
1	5		Combining these equal amounts of opposite charge produces zero charge.
1	5		These observations indicate that all neutral matter contains equal amounts of positive and negative charge.
0	5		The two types of charge are called positive and negative charges.
3	5		The definition of negative charge is as follows:* Negative charge is the type of charge acquired by a plastic comb that has been passed through hair a few times. 
0	5	SM	22.9 Does the B strip you created in Checkpoint 22.8 carry a positive charge or a negative charge? 
3	5		When two neutral objects touch, some charge can be transferred from one object to the other, with the result that one object ends up with a surplus of one type of charge and the other object ends up with an equal surplus of the other type of charge.
3	5		For example, when a neutral piece of styrofoam is rubbed with a neutral piece of plastic wrap, the styrofoam acquires a positive charge (meaning it contains more positive than negative charge) and the plastic wrap acquires a negative charge (it has a surplus of negative charge).
1	5		Without further information, however, we cannot tell whether positive charge has been transferred from the wrap to the styrofoam, or negative charge has been transferred from the styrofoam to the plastic wrap, or a combination of these two.
0	5		(See Figure 22.7 on the next page.)
2	5		Summarizing: All neutral matter contains equal amounts of positive and negative charge; charged objects contain unequal amounts of positive and negative charge.
0	5		In illustrations, surplus charge is represented by plus or minus signs.
0	5		Keep in mind, however, that these signs never represent the only type of charge in an object.
1	5		The plus signs on the positively charged styrofoam in Figure 22.7, for  example, mean only that the styrofoam contains more positive than negative charge, either because some of its negative charge has been removed or because some positive charge has been added.
1	5		In addition to the 12 positive charge carriers shown in Figure 22.7, the styrofoam contains millions and millions of positive charge carriers paired with millions and millions of negative charge carriers.
1	5		A drawing such as Figure 22.7, shows only unpaired charge carriers (usually referred to as surplus charge).
0	5		As our observations in Figure 22.6 show, oppositely charged B and T strips attract each other.
0	5		The interaction between positive and negative charge tends to bring positive and negative charge carriers as close together as possible.
1	5		Because combining equal amounts of positive and negative charge results in zero charge, we can say that charge carriers always tend to arrange themselves in such a way as to produce uncharged objects-indeed, all matter around us tends to be neutral. 
1	5	H3	*Historically, negative charge was (arbitrarily) defined by Benjamin Franklin (17061790) as the charge acquired by a rubber rod rubbed with cat fur.
0	5	FIG	Figure 22.6  Interactions of B and T charged strips.
1	6	SM	Because plastic combs and hair are more easily accessible than rubber rods and cat fur, the definition of negative charge given here is more convenient.
0	6	SM	22.10 Imagine having a collection of charged marbles that retain their charge even when they touch other objects.
0	6	SM	Red marbles are positively charged, and blue marbles are negatively charged.
0	6	SM	(a) What happens if you place a bunch of red marbles close together on a flat horizontal surface?
0	6	SM	(b) What happens if you do the same with a bunch of blue marbles?
0	6	SM	(c) What happens if you do the same with an equal mixture of red and blue marbles?
0	6	SM	(d) What happens in part c if you have a few more red marbles than blue ones?
0	6	SM	(e) As a whole, is the collection of marbles in part d positively charged, negatively charged, or neither? 
0	6	H1	22.3 Mobility of charge carriers 
1	6		To gain a better understanding of electrical charge, many additional experiments are required, most of which require items not easily found at home.
1	6		A rubber rod rubbed with a piece of cat fur acquires-by Benjamin Franklin's original definition-a negative charge (and the fur acquires a positive charge).
2	6		A glass rod rubbed with silk acquires a positive charge (and the silk a negative charge).
2	6		Other materials also acquire a charge upon contact or rubbing, but these two combinations of rubber/fur and glass/silk provide the most convenient means of generating relatively large amounts of charge.
0	6		Interesting things happen when a charged rubber rod is brought into contact with an uncharged pith ball.
0	6		* As the rod is brought near the ball, the ball moves toward the rod because of the attraction between the charged rod and the neutral ball ( Figure 22.8a).
0	6		As the ball touches the rod, however (Figure 22.8b), the crackling sounds of tiny sparks may be heard.
0	6		The ball suddenly jumps away from the rod (Figure 22.8c), indicating that the interaction between rod and ball has become repulsive.
0	6		This repulsive interaction indicates that the ball has acquired the same type of charge as the rod (negative).
1	6		In other words, some of the surplus negative charge on the rod has been transferred to the ball.
6	6		Charge can be transferred from one object to another by bringing the two into contact.
0	6		We can use this phenomenon to investigate the electrical behavior of different kinds of materials.
0	6		For example, if we transfer some charge to one end of an uncharged rubber rod and then extend the charged end toward an uncharged pith ball, the two interact electrically, as shown in Figure 22.9a.
0	6		If we hold the uncharged end near the pith ball, as in Figure 22.9b, however, no interaction occurs.
0	6		This tells us that the charge does not flow from one end of the rubber rod to the other; instead, it remains near the spot where it has been deposited.
1	6		Any material in which charge doesn't flow (or moves only with great difficulty) is called an electrical insulator.
2	6		Electrical insulators are materials through which charge carriers cannot flow easily.
0	6	FIG	Figure 22.7  Rubbing neutral styrofoam with neutral plastic wrap leaves the two objects with equal charges  of opposite types.
1	6	FIG	Figure 22.8  A charged rubber rod can transfer charge to a neutral pith ball.
2	7		Any charge transferred to an insulator remains near the spot at which it was deposited.
3	7		Glass, rubber, wood, and plastic are examples of electrical insulators.
3	7		Air, particularly dry air, is also an insulator, although the presence of large amounts of charge can cause charge carriers to "jump" from one object to another, causing sparks. 
0	7	SM	Exercise 22.1 Electric forces (a) Draw a free-body diagram for the pith ball in Figure 22.9a.
0	7	SM	(b) Two identical neutral pith balls A and B are suspended side by side from two vertical strings.
0	7	SM	After some charge is transferred from a charged rod to A, A and B interact.
0	7	SM	(B remains neutral because the two balls never come into contact with each other.)
0	7	SM	Sketch the orientation of A and B after the charge has been transferred to A.
0	7	SM	(c) Draw a free-body diagram for each ball. 
0	7	H3	Solution  (a) The ball is subject to three forces: a gravitational 
0	7	SM	force, a contact force exerted by the string, and an attractive electric force exerted by the charged particles in the rod.
0	7	SM	This last force is directed horizontally toward the rod.
0	7	SM	Because the ball is at rest, I know that the vector sum of these three forces is zero.
0	7	SM	So the horizontal component of the force exerted by the string on the ball must be equal in magnitude to the electric force exerted by the rod on the ball, and the vertical component of the force exerted by the string on the ball must be equal in magnitude to the gravitational force exerted by Earth on the ball (Figure 22.10a).Figure 22.10 (b) As we saw in Section 22.2, a neutral object interacts electrically with a charged object.
0	7	SM	The electric force exerted by A on B and that exerted by B on A form an interaction pair and so their magnitudes are equal.
0	7	SM	Because the masses of the pith balls are the same, each is pulled in by the same distance.
0	7	SM	Thus my sketch is as shown in Figure 22.10b.
0	7	SM	(c) See Figure 22.10c. 
0	7		In  Figure 22.11, a charged rod is brought into contact with an uncharged metal rod supported on an electrically insulating stand.
0	7		Once the charged rod has touched the metal rod, all points on the surface of the metal rod interact electrically with other objects, indicating that the charge spreads out over the metal rod.
0	7		The tendency of charge to spread out over metal objects can be demonstrated with an electroscope ( Figure 22.12a).
0	7		Two strips made of metal foil are suspended from a small metal rod in an electrically insulating enclosure; the rod is connected to a metal ball on top of the enclosure.
0	7		When the metal ball is charged by an exterior source, the strips move away from each other.
0	7		The explanation for this movement is that the added charge quickly moves from the metal ball through the metal rod and onto the two metal strips.
0	7	FIG	Figure 22.9  A rubber rod is an example of an electrical insulator.
1	7	FIG	Figure 22.11  A metal rod is an electrical conductor.
1	7	FIG	Figure 22.12  An electroscope depends on electrical conduction.
0	8		Once the strips carry the same type of charge, they repel each other (Figure 22.12b).
0	8		Another demonstration of the free motion of charges through metals is shown in Figure 22.13: When a long wire is used to connect a charged metal sphere to an uncharged metal sphere, charged particles flow from the charged sphere to the uncharged one.
1	8		Because wires are made of metal, this experiment shows that, in contrast to what happens with electrical insulators, charge moves easily through a metal and across a metal-to-metal contact.
1	8		Materials through which charge carriers can flow are called electrical conductors, and the flow of charge through conductors is called conduction.
2	8		Electrical conductors are materials through which charge carriers can flow easily.
3	8		Any charge transferred to a conductor spreads out over the conductor and over any other conductors in contact with it.
3	8		Metals are the only solid materials that are conductors at room temperature.
3	8		(As noted earlier, glass, plastic, and most other solids are electrical insulators.)
3	8		Although charge does not flow easily through pure water, minute amounts of impurities turn water into a fairly good conductor.
1	8		Because most water contains some impurities, water is therefore usually considered a conductor.
0	8		Except for the outer layer of soil, Earth is also a good conductor.
2	8		Consequently, when a charged, conducting object is connected to Earth by a wire, a process called grounding, charge carriers can flow between Earth ("ground") and the object.
2	8		Because Earth is so large, it can supply or absorb a nearly unlimited number of charge carriers.
2	8		In the absence of other nearby electrical influences, the grounded object is left with no surplus of either type of charge.
1	8		Because of its high water content, the human body is a conductor.
0	8		Consequently, any time you touch a charged ob-ject, as in Figure 22.14, some of the charge moves into you- you act like a grounding agent just the way Earth does.
1	8		As long as you keep touching the object, charge flows into your body, reducing the charge on the object (Figure 22.14).
0	8		If the charge on the object is large, the charge that accumulates on your hair makes your hair stand up and separate as far as possible, like the leaves of an electroscope (Figure 22.15). 
0	8	SM	22.11 (a) Why is it impossible to charge a metal rod held in your hand by rubbing the rod with other materials?
0	8	SM	(b) Why can you charge a rubber rod even when you hold it in your hand? 
0	8		Is charge some sort of fluid that flows from one object to another, or is it composed of small particles that can be peeled off or stuck onto objects?
0	8		To answer this question, we must look at the atomic structure of matter.
0	8		All matter consists of atoms (see Section 1.3), the structure of which is schematically illustrated in Figure 22.16.
0	8		Nearly all the atom's mass is concentrated in the extremely small nucleus at the center.
0	8		The nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons.
0	8	FIG	Figure 22.13  A conducting wire distributes charge between two conducting spheres.
3	8	FIG	Figure 22.14  Because of its water content, the human body is a  conductor.
0	9		The region surrounding the nucleus, representing most of the atom's volume, is a cloud of electrons.
0	9		Experiments show that electrons have a negative electrical charge-they are repelled by a charged comb* and by other electrons.
0	9		Protons carry a positive charge, and neutrons carry no charge.
0	9		The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are held together tightly by the strong interaction (see Chapter 7), which is great enough to overcome the electrical repulsion between the positively charged protons.
0	9		The electrical attraction between the positively charged nucleus and the negatively charged electrons is responsible for keeping the electrons bound to the nucleus.
0	9		The electron cloud does not collapse on the nucleus because of additional constraints imposed on the electrons by the laws of quantum mechanics.
1	9		Charge is an inherent property of the electron, which means it is impossible to remove the charge from an  electron- there is no such thing as a discharged electron.
2	9		Experiments show that All electrical charge comes in whole-number multiples of the electrical charge on the electron.
0	9		For this reason, the magnitude of the charge on the electron, designated by the letter e, is called the elementary charge.
0	9		Every atom contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.
1	9		Because atoms are neutral, the fact that they contain equal numbers of electrons and protons tells us that the magnitude of the positive charge on the proton is also e. The charge on an electron is - e, and that on a proton +e .
1	9		As with electrons, the charge cannot be removed from a proton.
0	9		Given that macroscopic objects contain an immense number of atoms and that each atom can contain dozens of electrons and protons, we see that ordinary objects contain an immense number of positively charged protons, exactly balanced by an equal number of negatively charged electrons.
1	9		An imbalance of just a minute fraction of these numbers is sufficient to give rise to a noticeable macroscopic charge.
0	9		For example, when you pull apart two strips of transparent tape, the separation causes an imbalance of less than one in a trillion (1012 ) electrons.
0	9		(Because there are about 1022 electrons in the strip, that fraction represents some 1010 , or ten billion electrons.)
0	9		When two atoms are brought close together, they may form a chemical bond by transferring one or more electrons from one atom to the other.
0	9		Once such an electron transfer takes place, both atoms contain unequal numbers of electrons and protons and are now called ions instead of  atoms.
0	9		One of the two ions has gained one or more electrons, meaning it contains more electrons than protons and therefore carries a negative charge.
0	9		The other ion, the one that lost electrons, contains more protons than electrons and so carries a positive charge.
0	9		Ions in solids are always immobile, but ions in liquids can move freely.
0	9		For instance, in table salt, a compound made of pairs of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions, the charged ions hardly move at all, meaning that solid table salt is an electrical insulator.
0	9		Dissolve table salt in water, however, and the solution contains large quantities of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions.
1	9		Because these ions can move freely, the solution is an elec-trical conductor.
0	9		Some solids are made not of paired ions the way sodium chloride is but rather of individual atoms.
0	9		In atomic solids that are electrical insulators, the electrons in the atoms are unable to move because each electron is bound to a specific atom.
1	9		Diamond (made of the element carbon) and glass are two familiar examples.
1	9		Metals are also atomic solids rather than ionic solids, but in metals, each atom gives up one or more electrons to a shared "gas" of electrons that spreads throughout the volume of the metal.
0	9		The metal as a whole is still neutral: The negative charge of the electron gas is exactly balanced by the positive charge of the ions.
1	9		The electrons in the gas are called free electrons because they can move freely inside the metal; these electrons are responsible for the easy flow of charge through a metal.
1	9		Nearly all electrical phenomena are due to the transfer of electrons-and therefore charge-from one atom to another.
1	9		For example, when the sticky side of one strip of transparent tape is applied on top of the nonsticky side of a second strip, atoms in the adhesive from the top strip form chemical bonds with atoms in the nonsticky surface of the bottom strip by transferring electrons, as shown in Figure 22.17 on the next page.
1	9		These bonds are responsible for the adhesion of one strip to the other.
2	9		When the strips are pulled apart quickly, the bonds are broken, but not all electrons manage to get back to the top strip.
1	9		The bottom strip thus ends up with a surplus of electrons, making it negatively charged, and the top one with a deficit of electrons, making it positively charged.

0	9	FIG	Figure 22.16  Structure of the atom (not to scale).
0	10		*Depending on the type of adhesive and the material of the backing, the transfer of electrons can also be in the other direction.
0	10		As we saw in Section 10.4, friction between two surfaces also involves the breaking of chemical bonds.
0	10		As with the separation of the tape strips, this bond breaking sometimes leaves surplus charge on the surfaces.
0	10		When you touch a piece of plastic food wrap to a piece of styrofoam, for instance, chemical bonds form between atoms on the two surfaces.
0	10		In these bonds, electrons from the styrofoam move to the wrap.
1	10		If you then rub the surfaces against each other, these bonds are broken, and some of the electrons originally on the styrofoam stay on the wrap.
1	10		If the breaking of the chemical bonds occurs slowly, the electrons migrate back and no surplus charge builds up.
1	10		For that reason it is necessary to rub vigorously or to separate strips of transparent tape quickly.
4	10		The key point is: Any two dissimilar materials become charged when brought into contact with each other.
4	10		When they are separated rapidly, small amounts of opposite charge may be left behind on each material.
1	10		Because charging by breaking of chemical bonds is due to a transfer of charge, we now see that for every surplus of negative charge that appears in one place, an equal surplus of positive charge appears somewhere else.
1	10		After the two strips in Figure 22.17 are separated, the sum of the positive charge on the T strip and the negative charge on the B strip is still zero.
1	10		No creation or destruction of charge is involved, suggesting that electrical charge-like momentum, energy, and angular momentum-is a conserved quantity.
0	10		The principle of conservation of charge states: Electrical charge can be created or destroyed only in identical positive-negative pairs such that the charge of a closed system always remains constant.
0	10		No process has ever been found to violate this principle.
1	10		Even when charged subatomic particles, such as electrons and protons, are created or destroyed-a process that can be observed in high-energy particle accelerators-charge is conserved.
1	10		For example, when an electron (charge - e) collides with a subatomic particle called the positron (charge +e ), both particles are destroyed, leaving nothing but a flash of highly energetic radiation (Figure 22.18a).
0	10		The charge of the electron-positron system before the collision is (- e) + (+e) = 0, and it is still zero after the collision.
1	10		Likewise, in a process called beta decay, when a free neutron (carrying zero charge and made up of two down quarks and one up quark) decays into a proton (charge +e, one down and two up quarks), an electron (charge - e), and a neutral subatomic particle called the antineutrino (zero charge), the charge of the system comprising the neutron and the particles into which it decays remains zero (Figure 22.18b and Section 7.6).

0	10		Let us now reexamine the interaction between a charged object and a neutral one.
0	10		Figure 22.19 shows the interaction between a charged rubber rod and an uncharged electroscope.
0	10		With the rod far away (Figure 22.19a), the leaves of the electroscope hang straight down.
0	10		When the rod is brought near the ball of the electroscope (Figure 22.19b), the leaves separate even without any contact between the rod and the electroscope.
0	10	FIG	Figure 22.17 How strips of tape can acquire opposite charges when pulled apart.
1	10	FIG	Figure 22.18 Because charge is conserved, the charge of a closed system does not change even when particles are created or destroyed.
0	11		As the distance between the rod and the electroscope is increased again, the leaves drop down, showing that no charge has been transferred from the rod to the electroscope.
1	11		Why do the leaves separate even though the electroscope remains neutral?
1	11		They separate because the negative charge on the rod repels the free electrons in the metallic parts of the electroscope: The free electrons are pushed as far away as possible from the rod (Figure 22.19c) and pile up in the leaves.
1	11		This redistribution of charge is nearly instantaneous.
0	11		The top of the electroscope thus ends up with a deficit of electrons-a positive charge-and the leaves end up with a surplus of electrons-a negative charge.
0	11		The negative charge on the leaves is responsible for the repulsion between them.
0	11		When the rod is removed, the electrons, being repelled by one another and attracted to the positive charge on the electroscope ball, immediately flow back to their normal positions, evening out the distribution of positive and negative charge. 
0	11	SM	22.13 (a) In Figure 22.19b, is the electroscope as a whole positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral?
0	11	SM	(b) How does the magnitude of the positive charge on the electroscope ball compare with the magnitude of the negative charge on the leaves?
0	11	SM	(c) Is the force exerted by the rod on the electroscope ball attractive or repulsive?
0	11	SM	Is the force exerted by the rod on the leaves attractive or repulsive?
0	11	SM	(d) How do you expect the magnitude of the force the rod exerts on the ball to compare with the magnitude of the force the rod exerts on the leaves? 
0	11		Any separation of charge carriers in an object is called charge polarization, or simply polarization, and an object in which charge polarization occurs is said to be polarized.
0	11		The electroscope of Figure 22.19b, for instance, is polarized by the nearby charged rod.
0	11		In any object in which charge is polarized, there are two charged poles, one positive and the other negative.
0	11		In the electroscope of Figure 22.19b, the positive pole is at the ball and the negative pole is in the foil strips.
1	11		In metals, the polarization induced by the presence of a nearby charged object is very great because the free electrons in the metal move easily in response to the presence of the charged object.
1	11		Even in electrical insulators, however, where there are no free electrons moving about, a nearby charged object induces some polarization.
2	11		The basic reason for the polarization of insulators is illustrated in Figure 22.20: In the presence of an external charge, the center of the electron cloud and the nucleus of an atom shift away from each other, causing the atom to become polarized.
0	11		So, when a negatively charged comb is brought near a small piece of paper, each atom in the paper becomes polarized-the electron clouds are pushed away from the comb, and the nuclei are pulled toward the comb.
0	11		If we consider the paper as consisting of two overlapping parts that have the same shape but carry opposite charges, the positively charged part is pulled a bit toward the comb and the negatively charged part is pushed away, as shown in Figure 22.21a on the next page.
1	11		This leaves the central part of the paper neutral but creates a sliver of surplus positive charge on the side facing the comb and an equal amount of surplus negative charge on the opposite side, and so the paper is polarized. 
0	11	SM	22.14  In an atom, what limits the separation between the electron cloud and the nucleus in the presence of an external charge?
0	11	SM	Why, for example, isn't the electron cloud in Figure 22.20b pulled all the way to the location of the external positive charge? 
0	11		The polarization of atoms is responsible for the attraction between charged and neutral objects.
0	11		In Figure 22.21, for example, the positively charged side of the paper is closer to the comb than the negatively charged side.
0	11		Because the electric force decreases with increasing distance, the magnitude of the attractive force exerted on the positive side is greater than the magnitude of the repulsive force exerted on the negatively charged side (Figure 22.21b).

0	12	SM	(b) Describe what would happen when a negatively charged comb is brought near an electroscope if protons, not electrons, were mobile in metals.
0	12	SM	(c) Can you deduce from the experiment illustrated in Figure 22.19 which charge carriers-electrons or protons-are mobile in metals? 
0	12		Figure 22.22 illustrates how you can exploit polarization to charge neutral conducting objects.
0	12		A negatively charged rod brought near a metal sphere induces polarization in the sphere.
1	12		To get as far away as possible from the negative charge on the rod, the electrons in the metal of the sphere move to the right surface.
3	12		Thus the surface of the sphere nearer the rod becomes the positive pole, and the surface farther from the rod becomes the negative pole.
3	12		When you touch the metal, the electrons can move into your body, thereby getting even farther away from the negative charge on the rod.
2	12		In essence, you have become the negative pole, while the sphere is the positive pole.
1	12		If you remove your hand from the sphere, the sphere is left with a deficit of electrons (they stayed inside you!)
0	12		and so carries a positive charge- it has become charged without ever touching a charged object.
1	12		(Likewise, you now have a surplus of negative charge and carry a negative charge, which is spread so thin that it is hardly noticeable.)

0	14	H1	22.5 Coulomb's law 
0	14		Quantitative experiments with electrical charge are difficult to carry out because objects lose their charge and because charge carriers on objects tend to rearrange themselves in the presence of other charged objects.
0	14		In the 18th century,  however, the English clergyman and scientist Joseph Priestley carried out a remarkable experiment: He charged a hollow sphere and showed that no electric force was exerted on a small piece of charged cork placed inside the sphere.
1	14		Remembering that Newton had proven that no gravitational force exists inside a hollow sphere (see the box "Zero gravitational force inside a spherical shell") because the gravitational force decreases with the square of distance, Priestley proposed that the electric force, too, decreases as In 1785, Charles Coulomb, a French physicist, provided direct evidence for an inverse-square law by measuring how the electric force between two charged spheres changes as the distance between the spheres changes.
0	14		The basic apparatus for Coulomb's experiment is shown in suspended from a long fiber.
2	14		When spheres A and B are charged, the electric A consequence of the inverse-square dependence on distance of the gravitational force is that a uniform spherical shell exerts no force at all on a mass placed anywhere inside it.
1	14		This result is very important in electrostatics because it provides a strong test of the law describing the electric force between charged objects.
0	14		Consider the uniform spherical shell in Figure 22.24a.
0	14		A particle of mass m is placed off-center inside the shell.
0	14		To determine the force exerted by the shell on the particle, consider first the force exerted by region 1, defined as a very small region of the shell surface.
0	14		Let the mass of this region be m1 and its distance from the particle be d1, which means the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by this region on the particle is Gm1m>d21.
0	14		Extending the cone defined by the particle and region 1 to the opposite side of the shell gives us a small region 2, of mass m2 and at distance d2 from the particle.
0	14		The magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by this region on the particle is Gm2m>d22 .
1	14		If the particle is closer to region 1 than to region 2, the area of region 2 must be greater than the area of region 1 (because of Zero gravitational force inside a spherical shell Figure 22.24 S

0	14		Figure 22.25.
0	14		A small dumbbell is how we defined region 2 as being an extension of the cone formed by region 1 and the particle), which means region 2 contains more mass: m27 m1.
0	14		Because the mass of the shell is distributed uniformly over the shell, the mass of each of our two regions is proportional to its area: m1>m2= a1>a2 .
0	14		Because they are marked out by similar cones, the areas of the two regions are proportional to the squares of the distances to the particle: a1>a2= d12>d22, which means thatm1m2=d21d22.
0	14		Rearranging terms, we find m1>d21= m2>d22 regardless of the position of the particle, and so we see that the forces cancel: The two regions exert forces of equal magnitude in opposite directions on the particle (Figure 22.24b).
0	14		We can now apply the same arguments to other pairs of small regions on either side of the particle, each yielding equal and opposite forces on the particle (Figure 22.24c).
0	14		The vector sum of all the forces exerted on the particle by all the small regions making up the spherical shell is thus zero. 
1	15		d22 m2 F2m = GmG m1 d12 F1m = GmG m force between them twists the fiber.
1	15		The amount of twist is a measure of the magnitude of the force between the two spheres (see also Section 15.7).
1	15		A similar arrangement was used a few years later by Cavendish to study gravitational interactions (see Section 13.5).
0	15		Coulomb also devised a method for systematically varying the "quantity of charge" q on a metal sphere.
1	15		He found that when a charged metal sphere is brought into contact with an identical uncharged metal sphere, the final charge is the same on each sphere-both exert a force of equal magnitude on a third charged object.
1	15		In other words, each sphere gets half the original charge.
1	15		By sharing charge among several identical metal spheres, Coulomb could produce spheres whose charge was one-half, one-quarter, one-eighth, and so on of the original charge (Figure 22.26).
0	15		By thus varying the charges on spheres A and B of his apparatus, Coulomb found that the electric force is proportional to the charge on each sphere.
3	15		We can summarize these findings in one equation, called Coulomb's law, which gives the magnitude of the electric force exerted by two charged particles separated by a distance r12 and carrying charges q1 and q2: FE12 = k q1 q2r212 .
0	15		(22.1) As we shall see in Chapter 27, the interaction between charged particles becomes more complicated when the particles are not at rest.
0	15		For this reason the force in Coulomb's law is sometimes called the electrostatic force and the branch of physics that deals with stationary distributions of charge is called electrostatics.
0	15		If the positions of the two charged particles are given by the vectors respectively, then the distance between them is r12= rS2 rS1 constant of proportionality k depends on the units used for charge, force, and length.
0	15		The absolute-value signs around the charges in Eq.
0	15		22.1 are necessary because q1 and q2 can be negative but the magnitude FE12 always be positive.
0	15		Coulomb's law bears a striking resemblance to Newton's law of gravity (Eq.
1	15		13.1): FG12 = G m1m2r212.
1	15		(22.2) Why these two laws have the same mathematical form remains a mystery.
0	15		The main differences between the two are that mass is always positive but electrical charge can be positive or negative, which means that the gravitational force is always attractive but the electric force can be attractive or repulsive.
1	15		The derived SI unit of charge, called the coulomb (C), is defined as the quantity of electrical charge transported in 1 s by a current of 1 ampere, a quantity and unit we shall define in Chapter 27.
0	15		One coulomb is equal to the magnitude of the charge on about 6.24  1018 electrons.
0	15		Conversely, the magnitude of the charge of the electron is e = 1>6.24  1018 C = 1.60  10-19 C. The charge on any object comes in only whole-number multiples of this elemen-tary charge: q = ne, n = 0,   1,   2,   3, .

0	18		Coulomb's law deals only with pairs of charged objects.
1	18		To find the force exerted by an assembly of objects carrying charges charge q1, we take the vector sum of all the forces exerted on object 1 by each of the other charged objects independently: where each term is given by Coulomb's law:gFS1E qqr21  qqr31  qqr41 In other words, we calculate the force exerted by object 2 on object 1, then  c alculate the force exerted by object 3 on object 1, and so forth, and then add the forces.

1	19		The basic limitation of Coulomb's law continues to apply when we are analyzing collections of charged objects: Eq.
1	19		22.10 is valid only for charged particles, not for charged extended bodies.
1	19		Suppose, for example, that we replace each charged particle in Figure 22.29 by a conducting sphere carrying the same charge as each particle.
0	19		Let us first consider just the interaction between spheres 1 and 2.
1	19		When these oppositely charged spheres are placed near each other, the charge carriers on the two spheres rearrange themselves to be as close as possible to each other ( Figure 22.30a).
1	19		A similar type of rearrangement takes place when just spheres 1 and 3 are placed near each other (Figure 22.30b).
2	19		When all three spheres are placed near one another, the positive charge on sphere 3 pushes the positive charge on sphere 2 up and pulls the negative charge on sphere 1 down (Figure 22.30c).

0	24		In this chapter we revisit an issue we discussed briefly in Chapter 7: the long-range nature of electric and gravitational interactions.
0	24		How does one charged object "reach out" and affect another charged object?
0	24		What are the invisible "springs" that pull us-and everything around us- toward Earth's surface?
0	24		You can describe these long-range interactions by saying that every charged object and every object that has mass has a "sphere of influence" surrounding it.
0	24		The modern word for this sphere of influence is field.
0	24		Fields are not imaginary.
0	24		That sensation you felt when, while reading the beginning of Chapter 22, you held a piece of plastic food wrap near your face was the sensation of a field created by the charged particles in the wrap.
0	24		The closer the wrap is to your skin, the stronger the sensation.
1	24		The concept of field is important for two reasons.
1	24		First, it is impossible to describe the interaction between moving charged particles without it.
2	24		Second, as you will soon see, it is often easier to deal with fields than with distributions of charge because frequently more is known about fields than about the way charge is distributed. 
0	24	H1	23.1 The field model 
1	24		Newton's law of gravity and Coulomb's law describing the electric force between charged particles successfully account for the magnitudes of the gravitational and electric forces between stationary objects.
2	24		However, they do not address the fundamental puzzle of how objects separated in space can interact without any mediator of the interaction (such an interaction is called action-at-a-distance).
4	24		Worse, they share a fundamental flaw: Both imply that the action of one object on another is instantaneous everywhere throughout space.
1	24		Consider, for example, the two metal rods in Figure 23.1.
1	24		Even if both are electrically neutral, their electrons interact.
1	24		Suppose you quickly drive the electrons in rod A down to the bottom, as in Figure 23.1b.
0	24		According to Coulomb's law, doing this will instantly change the force exerted by the electrons in A on those in B, regardless of how far apart the rods are.
0	24		This means that it would be possible-in principle-to be standing at one position in space and instantly detect a change that occurs at some far distant position.
1	24		The idea that an object can directly and instantly influence another object regardless of their separation was troubling in the 19th century but became untenable in the early 20th century when it was demonstrated experimentally that the interaction between charged objects is not instantaneous.
2	24		The principle illustrated in Figure 23.1, for example, is what makes possible the transmission of radio signals from a transmitting antenna (rod A) to a receiving antenna (rod B).
1	24		We know from many experiments that such transmission is not instantaneous.
1	24		As just one example, a radio signal takes about 0.1 s to travel from Earth's surface to an orbiting communications satellite.
1	24		In other words, the picture conveyed by Newton's law of gravity and Coulomb's law-that one object directly and instantly affects other objects regardless of the distance between them-cannot be correct.
0	24		Instead we must adopt another model of long-range interactions, a model in which interactions take place through the intermediary of an interaction  eld (or simply a  field).
0	24		In the field model, an interacting object fills the space around itself with a field.
0	24		When an object A is placed in the field of an object B, A can "feel" the presence of B's field.
1	24		Instead of the two objects interacting directly as illustrated in Figure 23.2a, it is the field created by each object that acts on the other object (Figure 23.2b).
1	24		The stronger the field, the greater the magnitude of the force resulting from the interaction.
1	24		In Figure 23.1, the electrons in rod B feel the field set up by the electrons in rod A.
3	24		When the electrons in A accelerate, their motion causes a disturbance in A's field, and this disturbance propagates outward through space like the ripples on the surface of a pond.
3	24		Only when these ripples in the field reach rod B can the motion of A's electrons be detected by those in rod B.
1	24		In Chapter 30 we shall study the propagation of disturbances in fields due to accelerating charge carriers.
0	24		For now, we shall concentrate on fields created by stationary objects.
1	24		The field model applies equally well to gravitational and electric interactions, with each interaction having its own type of field.
1	24		The space around any object that has mass is filled with a gravitational field, and the space around any electrically charged object is filled with an electric field.
0	24		Gravitational fields exert forces on objects that have mass, and electric fields exert forces on objects that either carry a charge or can be polarized.
0	24		Let's begin by developing the concept of gravitational field.
0	24		Before we attempt to find a physical quantity we can use to describe any gravitational field, we should note a number of things.
2	24		First, for any object A located in a gravitational field created by an object S (S is called the source of the field), the magnitude of the field felt by A depends only on the properties of S and on the position of A relative to S; the field magnitude does not depend in any way on the properties of A.
2	24		Second, the field of an object is always there, even when the object is not interacting with anything else.
0	24	FIG	Figure 23.1 Newton's and Coulomb's laws imply that forces are exerted instantaneously across a distance-but experiments show that they do not.
0	25		A field therefore must be represented by a set of numerical values that cover all the space outside the field source, with every point of this space having a different numerical value.
1	25		One field representation you are already familiar with is that of a "temperature field," where the temperature across the surface of a region has a specific value at each location ( Figure 23.3).
0	25		Third, for stationary objects the field model must give the same forces as Newton's law of gravity and Coulomb's law.
1	25		In particular, the field model must still yield forces between the two objects that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
1	25		It is not immediately obvious that the field model preserves this symmetry in the forces because a field is not something shared by two interacting objects-each object has its own field.
0	25		For example, in the gravitational interaction between a ball and Earth, the gravitational force exerted by Earth on the ball is due to Earth's gravitational field and the gravitational force exerted by the ball on Earth is due to the ball's field.
0	25		These two gravitational fields are very different from each other: Earth's field pulls strongly on, say, a paper clip, while the effect of the ball's field on that paper clip is unmeasurably small.
0	25		As you will see shortly, however, the symmetry of the interaction is preserved despite the asymmetry in the fields (see Checkpoint 23.3).
0	25		What physical quantity can we use to describe the gravitational field of an object?
0	25		How about the gravitational force exerted by the object?
0	25		Let's examine this possibility using Earth as our object.
1	25		As we saw in Section 8.8, the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by Earth on an object of mass m near Earth's surface is FEoG= mg.
1	25		This force is not a good quantity for describing Earth's field because the force depends not only on the source-Earth (which determines g)-but also on the mass m of the object placed in the field.
0	25		As illustrated in Figure 23.4, two objects that have dif-ferent masses m1 and m2 but are placed at the same height above Earth's surface are subject to different gravitational forces m1g and m2 g. The quantity g = FGE>m, however- the gravitational force per unit of mass-is the same for any object.
2	25		* This quantity is determined solely by the properties of Earth and is independent of those of any  object that experiences a gravitational force exerted by Earth. 
0	25	SM	23.1  Two objects 1 and 2, of mass m1 and m2, are released from rest far from Earth, at a location where the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity is much less than g = 9.8 m>s2.
0	25	SM	(a) What is the ratio FGE1>FGE2?
0	25	SM	(b) For these two objects, is the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by Earth per unit mass independent of the properties of the objects? 
0	25	FIG	Figure 23.2 The field model for interaction at a distance.
0	25	FIG	Figure 23.3 The temperature across a region is specified by a set of values, with a specific temperature value for every position in that region.
0	25	FIG	Such a set of values is called a field.
0	25	FIG	Figure 23.4 Comparison between gravitational force and gravitational acceleration on objects of different mass at the same distance from Earth.
0	26		*This is so because mass and inertia are equivalent (see Section 13.1), and so the force per unit of mass is equal to force divided by inertia, which is acceleration.
0	26		We can use the gravitational force per unit mass exerted by an object as a measure of the magnitude of the object's gravitational field.
0	26		For example, near Earth's sur-face, because g = 9.8 m>s2, the magnitude of Earth's gravi-tational field is 9.8 N>kg; near the surface of the Moon, where gmoon= 1.6 m>s2, the magnitude of the Moon's gravitational field is 1.6 N>kg.
0	26		(Remember that 1 N>kg = 1 (kg#m>s2)>kg = 1 m>s2.)
2	26		At any given location in the space surrounding a source object S, the magnitude of the gravitational field  created by S is the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted on an object B placed at that  location divided by the mass of B.
0	26		Unlike the temperature field in Figure 23.3, which is a scalar field, the gravitational field is a vector field: At every position, it has both a magnitude and a direction.
0	26		Figure 23.5, for example, shows a vector  eld diagram representing the gravitational field near Earth.
0	26		You can determine the magnitude and direction of this field in the space surrounding Earth using a test particle (an idealized particle whose mass is small enough that its presence does not perturb the object whose gravitational field we are measuring).
0	26		Measure, at each location, the gravitational force exerted by Earth on the test particle, and then divide that force by the mass of the test particle to obtain the direction and the magnitude of the gravitational field at that location.
0	26		As you can see from Figure 23.5, Earth's gravitational field, which can be represented at each position by a vector gS, always points  toward the  center of Earth, and its magnitude decreases with  increasing distance away from Earth.
0	26		Near Earth's surface, the magnitude of these vectors is g = 9.8 N>kg. 
1	26	SM	23.2 A communications satellite orbits 1.4  107 m from Earth's center, at a location where the magnitude of Earth's gravitational field is 2.0 N>kg. 
0	26	SM	(a) If the mass of the satellite is ms= 2000 kg, what is the magnitude of FSGEs?
0	26	SM	(b) If you place a 0.20-kg ball at the satellite's location, what is the magnitude of FSGEb? 
1	26		Checkpoint 23.2 illustrates that if you know the gravitational field at a certain position, you can easily calculate the gravitational force exerted by the source of that field on any object at that position by taking the product of the magnitude of the gravitational field at the location of the object and the mass of the object. 
1	26	SM	23.3 (a) Is the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by Earth on a ball greater than, equal to, or smaller than the magnitude of the gravitational force exerted by the ball on Earth?
0	26	SM	(b) Is the magnitude of Earth's gravitational field at the position of the ball greater than, equal to, or smaller than the magnitude of the gravitational field of the ball at a distance equal to Earth's radius?
0	26	SM	(c) Explain how the answers to parts a and b can both be correct. 
0	26	H1	23.2 Electric field diagrams 
0	26		Let us now apply the same ideas to electric interactions.
0	26		Figure 23.6a shows object 1 of mass m1 and charge q1 a distance d from a particle that carries a charge +q.
0	26		What is the electric field ES created by the particle at the position of object 1?
0	26		Before answering this question, answer the next checkpoint, which concerns the interactions of the particle with object 1 and with an object 2 of mass m2 and charge q2(Figure 23.6b; m2Z m1 and q2Z q1). 
1	26	SM	23.4 (a) Are the electric forces FSEp1 and FSEp2 in Figure 23.6 equal?
1	26	SM	(b) What does the quantity FSEpi>mi represent?
1	26	SM	(c) Is this quantity the same for objects 1 and 2?
1	26	SM	If not, what quantity is the same for both of these objects? 
0	26		As Checkpoint 23.4 makes clear, the quantity FSEpi>qi-the electric force per unit charge-is determined entirely by the source of the electric field and is independent of the object on which the field exerts a force.
0	26	FIG	Figure 23.5 Vector field diagram for the gravitational field in a region near Earth.
1	27		So, in analogy to the gravitational field, we can say: At any given location in the space surrounding a source object S, the electric field created by S is the electric force exerted on a charged test particle placed at that location divided by the charge of the test particle: ESSK FSStE>qt .
0	27		Like gravitational fields, electric fields are vector fields.
0	27		There is one difference between the two types of fields, however.
1	27		Electric interactions can be either repulsive or attractive, and so the direction of the electric force-and hence the direction of the electric field-depends on the sign of the charge.
8	27		Our rule is that: The direction of the electric field at a given location is the same as the direction of the electric force exerted on a positively charged object at that location. 
1	27	SM	23.5 (a) If the particle in Figure 23.6 carries a negative charge q 6 0 and q1 and q2 are positive, what are the directions of  FSEp1 and FSEp2 ?
0	27	SM	(b) Does the electric field created by the particle point toward or away from the particle?
0	27	SM	(c) If q and q2 are negative, what are the direction of FSEp2 and the direction of the electric field created by the particle at the location of object 2?
0	27	SM	(d) If q is positive, does the electric field created by the particle point toward or away from the particle?
0	27	SM	(e) How does the magnitude of the electric field created by a particle that carries a charge +q (q 7 0) compare with the magnitude of the electric field created by a particle that carries a charge - q of identical magnitude at a distance d from each particle? 
0	27		Figure 23.7 shows the vector field diagrams for the electric fields of particles that carry positive and negative charges.
0	27		Because it is impossible to draw electric field vectors at all locations, the diagrams show vectors at only certain positions; from these representative vectors you can get an idea of how the electric field looks as a whole.
0	27		In addition, the drawing is limited to two dimensions, but you should visualize the electric field as spreading out in all three dimensions.
1	27		Electric fields can be made visible by putting charged objects in a (nonconducting) liquid that contains small uncharged plastic fibers or grass seed.
1	27		Each fiber aligns  itself in the direction of the electric field at the fiber's location ( Figure 23.8). 
1	27	SM	23.6  If you know the electric field ES at some location, how can you determine the magnitude and direction of the electric force exerted by that field on an object carrying a charge q and placed at that location? 
0	27	H1	23.3 Superposition of electric fields 
0	27		The concept of electric field becomes especially useful when we consider the combined electric field that results from more than one charged object.
1	27		Suppose we are interested in the electric field created by two particles that carry charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign.
1	27		To find the electric field created by the particles at a point P, we place a test particle* carrying a positive charge qt at P and measure the vector sum of the forces exerted on it by the two charged source particles ( Figure 23.9 on the next page).
0	27		The electric field at P is then equal to this vector sum divided by qt.
2	27		Figure 23.9 illustrates the superposition of electric  elds: The combined electric field created by a collection of charged objects is equal to the vector sum of the electric fields created by the individual objects. 
2	27	FIG	Figure 23.7 Vector field diagrams for positively and negatively charged particles.
2	27	FIG	The lengths of the vectors show that the electric field magnitude decreases with increasing distance from the source.
1	27	FIG	Figure 23.8 Electric field pattern created by a small charged object in a solution that contains plastic fibers.
0	28		*When measuring electric fields, we assume that the charge qt on the test particle is so small that the particle does not perturb the particles or objects that generate the electric field we are measuring.
0	28		The superposition principle holds regardless of the number of sources.
0	28		Because of the vectorial nature of the electric interaction, electric forces add vectorially (Eq.
0	28		22.9).
0	28		Consequently the electric field at P is equal to (FSE1t+ FSE2t)>qt= FSE1t>qt+ FSE2t>qt, which is the vector sum of the electric fields created by the two sources individually.
0	28		The only caveat is the one I pointed out in Figure 22.30.
1	28		When we deal with conductors, the distribution of charge on the individual conductors in isolation might be different from what it is when the conductors are placed close together.

0	29		A more complete view is given in Figure 23.12.

1	29		Note how the pattern of vectors resembles the pattern created by two identically charged particles in a solution of plastic fibers (Figure 23.13).
1	29		Using the superposition principle, we can determine the electric field produced by any system of charged particles.
1	29		Figure 23.14, for example, shows a vector diagram for the electric field generated by three charged particles.
0	29		Because every charged object is made up of charged particles- electrons and protons-we can determine the electric field of any object at any position in space.

0	30	H1	23.4  Electric fields and forces 
1	30		Before developing additional techniques for determining the electric fields created by systems of charged particles, let us consider this question: What are the forces exerted by an electric field on charged or polarized objects?
0	30		One of the advantages of working with electric fields is that, for any system of charged particles, once we know the electric field the system creates at some point P in space, we can determine the force exerted by the system on any other charged particle placed at P without worrying about any of the individual source particles in the system anymore.
0	30		* In Chapter 22 we used the action-at-a-distance model to discuss the forces exerted by charged objects either on other charged objects or on polarized objects.
0	30		Now we can use the field model to do the same thing.
0	30		For stationary charged particles, both methods must yield the same result.
2	30		When we study the forces exerted by electric fields, it is useful to distinguish between uniform and nonuniform.
3	30		In a uniform electric field, the direction and magnitude of the electric field are the same everywhere.
3	30		No electric field is ever uniform throughout all space, but as we shall see in Section 23.7 it is possible to create regions of space where the electric field is uniform.
3	30		In a nonuniform electric field, the direction and magnitude of the electric field vary from position to position.
2	30		(All the electric fields we have considered so far are nonuniform.)
0	30		Let us first consider what happens to a charged particle placed in a uniform electric field.
0	30		Because the electric field is defined as the electric force per unit of charge, the force FSpE exerted by an electric field ES on a particle carrying a charge q is FSpE= qES.
0	30		Because ES is the same everywhere, the force FSpE exerted on the particle is constant and so it undergoes a constant acceleration aS= FSEp>m = qES>m = (q>m)ES, where m is the particle's mass.
2	30		A charged particle placed in a uniform electric field undergoes constant acceleration. 
1	30	H3	*This procedure is valid only if the presence of the charged particle at P does not alter the way charge is distributed over the system.
1	30	H3	We shall refer to the particle or system of particles that creates the electric field at P as being "fixed."
0	30	H3	When dealing with forces exerted by fields, we drop the subscript representing the object that exerts the force (the "by" subscript) because the field is due to all objects other than the object on which the force is exerted.
0	30	H3	The superscript E reminds us that we are dealing with the force exerted by an electric field. 
0	30		If the particle carries a positive charge, q 7 0,  FSpE and aS point in the same direction as ES.
0	30		If q 6 0, FSpE and aS point in the direction opposite the direction of the electric field (Figure 23.15).
0	30		Note from aS= (q>m)ES  that the magnitude of the acceleration depends on the magnitude of the electric field and on the charge-to-mass ratio q>m of the particle.
1	30		A large charge q causes a greater force to be exerted on the particle and therefore a greater acceleration; a larger mass m means the particle has greater inertia and therefore the acceleration is smaller.
1	30		Because we have already studied motion with constant acceleration, we can apply our knowledge to the motion of charged particles in a uniform electric field.
1	30		In general, the trajectory of these particles is parabolic, like the trajectory of a projectile fired near Earth's surface, where the gravitational field can be considered uniform over a limited area.
1	30		In the special case where the initial velocity of a charged particle is parallel to the direction of the electric field, the trajectory is a straight line, like the vertical fall of an object released from rest.
1	30		The main difference between the motion of projectiles near Earth's surface and the motion of charged particles in an electric field is that Earth's gravitational field is always directed vertically downward, whereas the electric field can be in any direction. 
0	30	SM	Example 23.2 Charged particle trajectories Four charged particles are fired with a horizontal initial velocity vS  into a uniform electric field that is directed vertically downward.
0	30	SM	The effect of gravity is negligible.
0	30	SM	The particles have the following charges and masses: particle

0	30	SM	Because the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of the particles' initial motion, they all have a parabolic trajectory.
0	30	SM	The positively charged particles have a constant downward acceleration; the negatively charged particle has a constant upward acceleration.

0	31		The magnitude of the electric 
0	31	SM	force exerted on particle 2 is the same as that exerted on particle 1, but the acceleration of particle 2 is smaller because this particle has the greater mass.
0	31	SM	I indicate this difference in acceleration by making trajectory 1 more curved than trajectory 2.
0	31	SM	The magnitude of the electric force exerted on particle 3 is twice as great as that exerted on particle 1, but 3's mass is also twice as great, and so the two particles have the same charge-to-mass ratio and therefore the same acceleration and trajectory.
0	31	SM	The magnitude of the electric force exerted on particle 4 is the same as that exerted on particle 1 but points in the opposite direction, and so trajectories 1 and 4 are identical in shape but curve in opposite directions.

0	31	SM	increasingly positive charge-to-mass ratios curve increasingly downward.
0	31	SM	Conversely, particles with increasingly negative charge-to-mass ratios curve increasingly upward.
0	31	SM	This is what I expect because a particle's deflection is a function of both its charge, which determines the magnitude of the force exerted by the electric field on it (greater charge, greater deflection), and its mass, which relates the particle's acceleration to the force exerted on it (greater mass, smaller deflection).
1	31	SM	23.9  A water droplet carrying a positive charge is released from rest in a uniform horizontal electric field near Earth's surface.
1	31	SM	The horizontal electric force is comparable in magnitude to the gravitational force exerted by Earth.
0	31	SM	Describe the droplet's trajectory. 
1	31		In a nonuniform electric field, the force exerted on a charged particle varies from one position to another, so we cannot easily specify the particle's trajectory without knowing more about the electric field.
2	31		As in a uniform electric field, however: A positively charged particle placed in a nonuniform electric field has an acceleration in the same direction as the electric field; a negatively charged particle placed in such a field has an acceleration in the opposite direction.
1	31		In Chapter 22 we found that charged objects can polarize electrically neutral objects by separating the centers of positive and negative charge in the latter.
2	31		The resulting configuration of charge-equal amounts of positive and negative charge separated by a small distance-is called an electric dipole or simply dipole.
3	31		Many molecules, such as water molecules, are permanent dipoles; that is to say, the centers of positive and negative charge are kept separated by some internal mechanism.
3	31		Figure 23.17 illustrates the forces exerted on a permanent electric dipole in a uniform electric field.
2	31		Because the electric field is uniform and the magnitude of the charge on the positive end of the dipole is equal to the magnitude of the charge on the negative end, the forces exerted on the two ends are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, making their vector sum zero.
2	31		However, the forces exerted on the two ends cause a torque  (see Chapter 12). 
2	31	SM	23.10 (a) What effect does the torque caused by the electric field have on the electric dipole in Figure 23.17?
1	31	SM	(b) Is the torque the same for every orientation of the molecule? 
1	31		The orientation of an electric dipole can be characterized by a vector, the dipole moment, that, by definition, points from the center of negative charge to the center of positive charge, as shown in Figure 23.18 on next page.
1	31		As Checkpoint 23.10 illustrates, the electric forces create a torque on the dipole that tends to align the dipole moment with the electric field.
0	31		In a nonuniform electric field, the situation is more complicated because the two ends of the dipole are now subject to forces that have different magnitudes as well as different directions.
0	31		Consider, for example, the nonuniform electric field in Figure 23.18a, which is due to a positively charged particle to the left side of the figure.
0	31		The magni-tude of FS-E is greater than the magnitude of FS+E because the negative end of the dipole is closer to the positively charged particle.
2	31	FIG	Figure 23.17 Extended free-body diagram for a permanent dipole placed in a uniform electric field.
0	32		Thus the vector sum of the forces exerted on the two ends is nonzero, and so the dipole experiences an acceleration whose magnitude and direction depend on its orientation with respect to the electric field.
0	32		In addition, the forces create a torque about the dipole's center of mass.
2	32		As in a uniform electric field: A permanent electric dipole placed in an electric field is subject to a torque that tends to align the dipole moment with the direction of the electric field.
4	32		If the field is uniform, the dipole has zero acceleration; if the electric field is nonuniform, the dipole has a nonzero acceleration.

0	33	SM	1.
0	33	SM	The gravitational field is defined as the gravitational force per unit of mass, with the field direction the same as the direction of the force.
0	33	SM	The electric field is defined as the electric force per unit of charge, with the field direction parallel to that of the force exerted on a positively charged particle.
0	33	SM	Therefore, the chromatic field can be defined as the chromatic force per unit of color, with the field direction parallel to that of the force exerted on a particle carrying some chosen color.

0	33	SM	(a) No.
0	33	SM	Uncharged particles don't interact with electric fields.
0	33	SM	(Remember that a particle has no extent and therefore cannot be polarized.)
0	33	SM	(b) Yes, because any particle or object, charged or uncharged, interacts with a gravitational field.
0	33	SM	3.
0	33	SM	(a) The electric field of particle 1 points away from the particle, which means that at P it points to the right and down.
0	33	SM	The electric field of particle 2 points toward the particle, meaning to the left and down at P. The vector sum of the electric fields at P therefore points straight down (Figure 23.21a ).
0	33	SM	(b) The gravitational fields of the two particles point toward them from P, and so their vector sum points to the left (Figure 23.21b).

0	33	SM	(a) Recall from the discussion following Checkpoint 23.4 that the direction of the electric field at a given location is the same as the direction of the electric force exerted on a positively charged particle at that location.
0	33	SM	In Figure 23.20a, therefore, the positively charged particle experiences a force directed to the right.
0	33	SM	Because its initial velocity is zero, the particle moves in a straight line in the direction of the electric field.

0	33	SM	This particle moves in a straight line up the page.
0	33	SM	(c) The negatively charged particle in Figure 23.20c experiences an acceleration to the right, in the direction opposite the direction of the electric field.

0	35		Next we examine the electric field due to a permanent electric dipole.
0	35		Figure 23.24 on the next page shows a dipole that consists of a particle carrying a charge x = 0, y = +12 d, and another particle carrying a charge where d is the distance between the two particles.
0	35		The charge charged pole is called the dipole charge, and the distance d is called the dipole separation.
0	35		Each particle creates an electric field at all positions in space, so the two fields overlap everywhere.
0	35		We can determine the combined electric field at any position by adding the two fields vectorially.

0	36		of the positively Along the x axis, which bisects the dipole, the magnitudes of the electric fields due to the two ends of the dipole are equal:  E The x components of these two electric fields point in opposite directions and so add to zero.
2	36		The magnitude of the combined electric field is thus equal to the sum of the y components: = -a2k qpx2+ (d>bad>2[x (d>2)]>b q d[x (d>2)]>The product qpd is a measure of the strength of the dipole and is the magnitude of the dipole moment introduced in Section 23.4.
1	36		To specify both the strength and the orientation of the dipole we can write this quantity as a vector, called the dipole moment: where rSp K rS-+= rS rSrelative to the negatively charged particle (and so taken to be positive, the dipole moment along the axis of the dipole (the line that passes through the center of each particle), in the direction from the negative to the positive pole ( permanent dipole moments can be caused either by a large dipole separation d or by a large dipole charge the dipole moment as a measure of how strongly the dipole wants to align itself in the direction of an electric field.

1	36		Ey - k px The right side of this equation is negative for both positive and negative x, and so anywhere along the x axis the dipole's electric field y direction, opposite the direction of the dipole moment.
1	36		Equation 23.10 also shows that the magnitude of the electric field is inversely proportional to contrast to the electric field of a charged particle, which is inversely proportional to x2 (Eq.
0	36		23.4).
0	36		The reason the electric field of a dipole approaches zero faster as x increases is that the angle between as x increases, and so the electric fields of the two poles tend to cancel each other more and more.
0	36		Along the y axis, the electric field created by either end of the dipole is directed along the y axis.
0	36		Thus to find the y component of the electric field of the dipole at any position along the y axis, we must add the y components of the fields from each particle.

0	37		The right side of this equation has the same algebraic sign as y, so the dipole's electric field ES points in the positive y direction.
0	37		(Carrying out the same calcula-tion for y 6 - d>2, you can show that the electric field still points in the positive y direction.
0	37		In between the two charged particles, the electric field points in the negative y direction.)
0	37		The magnitude of the electric field is inversely proportional to y3 -just as along the x axis, the electric fields of each of the two poles tend to cancel each other more and more as the distance from the dipole increases.
0	37		One can show that the electric field of the dipole depends on from the dipole (where r is the distance between the point under consideration and the center of the dipole).
0	37		The reason is that the electric fields of the positive and negative ends of the dipole partially cancel each other, and this cancellation becomes more complete far from the dipole: The farther you are from the dipole, the smaller the separation between the charged particles appears to be.

2	37	H1	23.7 Electric fields of continuous charge distributions 
0	37		So far we have dealt with only charged particles because Coulomb's law applies only to charged particles.
0	37		However, most charged objects of interest-from charged combs to electrical components-are not particles.
0	37		Instead, they are  extended bodies.
0	37		Although every macroscopic object consists of very large numbers of charged particles-protons and electrons-it is not practical to calculate the individual field of each of these particles and then add them vectorially.
1	37		Instead, we shall treat any macroscopic charged object as having a continuous charge distribution and calculate the electric field created by the object by dividing the charge distribution on the object into infinitesimally small segments that may be considered charged source particles carrying a charge 
0	37		For the charged macroscopic object shown in Figure 23.26, for example, we can use Coulomb's law to find the infinitesimal portion of the electric field at point P contributed by a segment:  dESs(P) = k dqsrsP2rnsP .
0	37		(23.14) Using the principle of superposition, we can then sum the contributions of all the segments that make up the object.
0	37		Because the segments are infinitesimally small, this sum corresponds to an integral:  ES=3dESs= k3dqsrsP2rnsP.
1	37	FIG	Figure 23.26  To calculate the electric field created at P by a continuous charge distribution, we divide the distribution into infinitesimally small segments that can be treated as charged source particles carrying charge dqs.
0	37		(23.15) In order to evaluate this integral, we must express of the same coordinate(s).
0	38		To do so, it is necessary to express the charge on the object in terms of a charge density-the amount of charge per unit of length, per unit of surface area, or per unit of volume. (23.13)1>r3 for all positions far dqs.
1	38		For a one-dimensional object, such as a thin charged wire of length along the wire, the linear charge density-the amount of charge per unit of length (in coulombs per meter)-is given by  l K 
1	38		For uniformly charged two-dimensional objects, we use the surface charge density-the amount of charge per unit of area (in coulombs per square meter).
0	38		For example, the surface charge density of a flat plate of area A carrying a uniformly distributed charge q is s K 
0	38		For a uniformly charged three-dimensional object, we use the volume charge density:  r K which gives the amount of charge per cubic meter.

0	39	SM	For each segment above the x axis there is a corresponding segment below the axis at the same distance from P. The y components of the electric fields dESs due to these two segments add up to zero, so I need to calculate only the x component dEsx .
0	39	SM	To get the electric field created by the entire rod, I use Eq.

0	39	SM	The x component of the electric field created by each segment at P is thus  dEsx= k dqsrsP2cos u = k q/rsP2 cos u dy, (1)where u is the angle between the x axis and the line that connects the segment dy with P. Both u and rsP depend on the position y of the segment, so I must choose one integration variable and express the others in terms of that variable.
0	39	SM	I choose u as the integration variable, which means I must express the factor dy>r2sP in Eq.

0	39	SM	When P is very close to the rod, x V /, I can ignore the x2 term in the denominator and write  Ex=2k(q>/)x=2klx.
0	39	SM	(5)In this x V / case, the distance from P to either end of the rod is much greater than the distance from P to the closest point on the rod (which is the rod midpoint, located at the origin), and thus the rod essentially looks "infinitely long" to an observer at P. Indeed, Eq.
0	39	SM	5 shows that my result no longer depends on /.
0	39	SM	I also note that the rod's electric field is now inversely proportional to x rather than x2.
0	39	SM	I saw in Chapter 17 that the amplitudes of waves that spread out in three dimensions are inversely proportional to x2, whereas the amplitudes of waves that spread out in two dimensions are inversely proportional to x.

0	42	H1	23.8 Dipoles in electric fields 
0	42		Let us end this chapter by considering the forces exerted by electric fields on di-poles.
0	42		Figure 23.32a shows a dipole consisting of two particles that carry charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign connected by a rod of length d; the dipole makes an angle u with a uniform electric field source.
1	42		As we saw in Section 23.4, the forces exerted by the electric field on the charged ends of the dipole are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, and so the vector sum of the forces exerted on the dipole is zero.
1	42		Consequently the acceleration of the center of mass of the dipole is zero.
1	42		Because the forces are exerted on opposite ends of the dipole, however, they create torques that cause the dipole to rotate counterclockwise about its center of mass.
0	42		Figure 23.32b shows that the force exerted on the positive end causes a counterclockwise torque of magnitude  twhere r# is the lever arm of the force.
0	42		The force exerted on the negative end causes an identical torque because the lever arm and the magnitude of the force are the same.
0	42		The electric field thus causes a torque on the dipole equal togtq 112d2qpEqpdEpE 
0	42		This can be written in vectorial form aswhere pS  is the dipole moment, which by definition points from the negative end of the dipole to the positive end and whose magnitude is given by Eq.
0	42		23.9.
0	42		According to the right-hand rule (see Section 12.4), the vector product pS ES in Eq.
0	42	FIG	Figure 23.32  The torque on an electric  dipole caused by an electric field tends to align the  dipole moment pS with the direction of the  electric  field.
0	42		23.21 gives a torque that points out of the plane of the drawing in (23.20)gtS= pS ES, (23.21) Figure 23.32c.
1	43		As we saw in Section 12.8, such a torque indeed causes a counterclockwise rotation.
1	43		The torque on the dipole is maximum when the dipole moment is perpendicular to the electric field and zero when it is parallel or antiparallel to the electric field. 
0	43	SM	23.16  Is Eq.
0	43	SM	23.20 valid if the center of mass is not in the middle of the dipole? 
1	43		As we saw in Section 23.4, the vector sum of the forces exerted on dipoles in nonuniform electric fields is not zero.
1	43		Consider, for example, the situation illustrated  in Figure 23.33a.
0	43		A dipole with its dipole moment y axis is placed in the nonuniform electric field generated by a particle carrying a charge q and located at the origin.
0	43		Because the distance between the negative end of the dipole and the particle is smaller than the distance between the positive end and the particle, the magnitude of the attractive force F tive end is greater than the repulsive force FSEp+ on the positive end.
0	43		Consequently the vector sum of the forces exerted by the nonuniform field on the dipole is nonzero, and the dipole is attracted to the particle.
0	43		How does this attraction vary with the position y of the dipole?
0	43		To answer this question, we can write an expression for the vector sum of the forces gFSEd exerted on the two ends of the dipole and examine how this sum varies with y. Alternatively, we can calculate the force FSEdp on the particle, using our results from Section 23.6.
1	43		This force and the vector sum of the forces exerted by the particle on the dipole form an interaction pair, and so their magnitudes are the same.
1	43		Equation 23.13 tells us that, along the dipole axis, the magnitude of the electric field created by the dipole is and so the magnitude of the force exerted by the dipole on the particle is  FEdp= qEd= 2k pqy3.
0	43		(23.22) The magnitude of the force exerted by the particle on the dipole, being equal in magnitude to FEdp, is thus  FEpd = FEp- FEp+= 2k pqy3.

0	44	SM	23.17  How does doubling each of the following quantities affect the force between a dipole and a particle placed near the dipole and carrying charge q?
0	44	SM	(a) the charge q, (b) the dipole separation d of the dipole, (c) the dipole charge tance between the dipole and the charged particle 
0	44		As we saw in Chapter 22, electrically neutral objects interact with a charged object because they become polarized in the presence of the charged object.
0	44		Consider an isolated neutral atom.
1	44		The centers of the atom's positive and negative charge distributions coincide, and therefore the atom's dipole moment is zero: d = 0 and so field-that is, an electric field created by some other charged object-causes a separation between the positive and negative charge centers and so induces a dipole moment (Figure 23.34b).
1	44		To understand the interaction between charged objects and neutral ones, we must therefore study the interaction between a charged particle and what is called an induced dipole.
1	44		The first question to ask is: How does the magnitude of the induced dipole moment depend on the presence of a charged particle?
1	44		When a neutral atom is placed in an electric field the electric forces exerted by that field on the charged particles in the atom are not too large, the induced dipole separation 
1	44		In other words, the induced dipole separation is proportional to the magnitude of the applied electric force, atom.
1	44		We can rewrite this as to the magnitude of the induced dipole moment force exerted on the dipole is proportional to the magnitude E of the electric field at the position of the dipole, the induced dipole moment is proportional to the field at the position of the dipole:where a, the polarizability of the atom, is a constant that expresses how easily the charge distributions in the atom are displaced from each other. qp, (d) the dis-pS=0S (Figure 23.34a).The presence of an external electric ES, it is found that, as long as dind in the atom obeys Hooke's law.

0	45		The electric field of a charged particle is given by Eq.
0	45		23.4, so the magnitude of the induced dipole moment is proportional to the inverse square of the distance between the particle and the dipole:  pind= aE = a k qy2.
0	45		(23.25) In contrast, the dipole moment of a permanent dipole is constant.

0	48		In principle, Coulomb's law allows us to calculate the electric field produced by any discrete or continuous distribution of charged objects.
0	48		In practice, however, the calculation is often so complicated that the sums or integrals that arise might require numerical evaluation on a computer.
0	48		For this reason, it pays to search for additional methods to determine the electric field produced by a charge distribution.
0	48		In this chapter we develop a relationship between an electric field and its source, known as Gauss's law, that can be used to find the electric fields due to charge distributions that exhibit certain simple symmetries.
0	48		These symmetries appear in many common applications, which makes Gauss's law an important tool in calculating electric fields.
0	48		As we shall see in Chapter 30, Gauss's law is one of the fundamental equations of electromagnetism- the theory that describes electromagnetic interactions and electromagnetic waves. 
0	48	H1	24.1 Electric field lines 
1	48		In Chapter 23 we used vector field diagrams to visualize electric fields.
1	48		Another way to visualize electric fields, which will help us reach some new insights, is to draw electric  eld lines.
1	48		These lines are drawn so that at any location the electric field ES is tangent to them.
1	48		Because the electric field is a vector, we assign to field lines a direction that corresponds with the direction of the electric field.
0	48		To draw an electric field line, imagine placing a test particle carrying a positive charge qt somewhere near a charge distribution.
0	48		Then move the test particle a small distance in the direction of the electric force exerted on it.
0	48		(Remember from Chapter 23 that the electric field points in the same direction as the electric force exerted on a positively charged test particle.)
1	48		Repeat the procedure to trace out a line ( Figure 24.1).
1	48		We label the field lines with the symbol E to remind us that they represent an electric field. 
0	48	SM	24.1  Draw several field lines representing the electric field of an isolated positively charged particle.
0	48	SM	Repeat for a negatively charged particle. 
0	48		As Checkpoint 24.1 illustrates, the field line diagrams for a positive and for a negative isolated charged particle are similar, even though the electric fields point in opposite directions.
0	48		They point radially outward from a positively charged particle and point radially inward toward a negatively charged particle.
1	48		This direction means that electric field lines always start from a positively charged object and always end on a negatively charged object, never the other way around.
1	48		Because an electric field is present everywhere around a charged object, a field line passes through every location in space.
1	48		In practice, we draw only a finite number of field lines to represent the entire field.
0	48		Figure 24.2, for example, shows the pattern of field lines created by a pair of oppositely charged particles (that is, a dipole).
0	48		Sixteen field lines emanate from the positively charged particle on the left, and 16 field lines terminate on the negatively charged particle on the right.
0	48		Notice the correspondence between this pattern and the corresponding vector field diagram in Figure 24.3a and the pattern created by the fibers in  Figure 24.3b.
0	48		The number of field lines that emanate from a positively charged object is arbitrary; we could have chosen some number other than 16 for Figure 24.2.
8	48	FIG	Figure 24.1 Using a positively charged test particle to trace out an elec-tric field line.
4	49		However, in a given field line diagram, the number of field lines is always proportional to the magnitude of the charge carried by the object.
2	49		If, for example, 16 field lines emanate from an object that carries a charge +q,  then 32 lines emanate from an object that carries a charge +2q and eight lines terminate on an object that carries a charge - q>2.
5	49		The number of field lines that emanate from a positively charged object or terminate on a negatively charged object is proportional to the charge carried by the object.

1	50		From Checkpoint 24.3, we see that the electric field and the number of field line crossings per unit area both decrease as 1>r2.
1	50		To express this correspondence quantitatively, we define a new quantity, the  eld line density: The field line density at a given position is the number of field lines per unit area that cross a surface perpendicular to the field lines at that position.
2	50		Figure 24.6 illustrates why the surface through which the field lines pass must be perpendicular to the field lines.
0	50		The field represented by the field lines in the figure is uniform-its magnitude and direction are the same everywhere.
1	50		As you can see in the figure, the number of field lines that cross the surface depends on the orientation of the surface.
1	50		The number of field lines that cross the surface is maximum when the surface is perpendicular to the field lines and decreases for any other orientation.
0	50		We shall see later in this chapter how to account for the orientation of a surface when calculating field line density.
2	50		Because the number of field lines in a field line diagram is arbitrary, the field line density is also an arbitrary number, and so you may be wondering why field line density is a useful quantity.
2	50		As you will see shortly, however, the field line density allows us to draw conclusions about electric field magnitudes.
3	50		The only condition we make is that, in a given field line diagram, the number of field lines emanating from or terminating on charged objects is proportional to the magnitude of the charge carried by these objects.

1	50		For the spherical surfaces of Checkpoint 24.3, the field lines are all perpendicular to the surface because the field lines are radial.
0	50		The number of field line crossings you calculated per unit area is the field line density.
2	50		These results lead us to conclude: At every position in a field line diagram, the magnitude of the electric field is proportional to the field line density at that position.

4	51		Checkpoint 24.5 leads us to another result that will be important in deriving Gauss's law: Whenever a charged particle is placed inside a hollow spherical surface, the number of field lines that pierce the surface is the same regardless of where inside the surface the particle is placed.
1	51		This is true simply because so long as the charged particle is inside the surface, all the field lines emanating from the particle must go through the spherical surface.

0	52	SM	(c) If the sphere is pierced by 20 field lines, what can you deduce about the combined charge on objects inside the sphere? 
0	52		A surface that completely encloses a volume is called a closed surface.
0	52		Checkpoint 24.6 suggests that a direct relationship exists between the number of field lines that cross a closed surface and the enclosed charge-the sum of all charge enclosed by that surface.
0	52		However, what happens if a field line reenters the closed surface, as illustrated in three times, so the number of field line crossings is not six but eight.
0	52		If you look closely at the figure, however, you will discover that not all the crossings are the same.
1	52		For seven of the crossings the field line goes outward (from the inside of the closed surface to the outside), while for the eighth crossing the field line goes inward.
2	52		If we assign a value of +1  to each outward crossing and a value of - 1 to each inward crossing, we obtain (+7) + (- 1) = 6.
2	52		To keep track of the number of inward and outward field crossings, we define a new quantity called the field line flux: For any closed surface, the field line flux is the number of outward field lines crossing the surface minus the number of inward field lines crossing the surface.
1	52		In calculating the field line flux for any closed surface, we assign a value of +1  to each outward field line crossing the surface and a value of - 1 to each inward field line crossing the surface

1	53		(b) Are there any closed surfaces enclosing a charged particle through which the field line flux is different from that through a simple sphere around that particle?
0	53		The field line flux through any closed surface is always equal to the number of field lines that originate from within that surface minus the number of field lines that terminate on charged objects within that surface.
5	53		So far, we have drawn an arbitrary number of field lines, but we can make our statement more precise: The field line flux through a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed by the surface multiplied by the number of field lines per unit charge.
0	53		What about charged objects outside the closed surface?

0	53	SM	(b) Does your answer to part a change if we move the particle around (but keep it outside the volume enclosed by the surface)? 
1	53		Checkpoint 24.8 demonstrates a very important point: The field line flux through a closed surface due to charged objects outside the volume enclosed by that surface is always zero.
0	53		This means that if we know the field line flux through a closed surface, then we can determine the charge enclosed by that surface, regardless of the distribution of charge outside the surface.
0	53		This statement is a form of Gauss's law, which we shall describe mathematically in Section 24.7.

0	53	FIG	+1?E24.4 Symmetry and Gaussian surfaces
1	54		The relationship between field line flux and enclosed charge allows us to reach several important conclusions about charged objects and their electric fields without having to do any calculations.
1	54		To apply this relationship in a given situation, we first need to select a closed surface.
2	54		This surface need not correspond to a real object-any surface, real or imagined, will do.
3	54		We'll refer to these closed surfaces as Gaussian surfaces.
3	54		The choice of surface is dictated by the symmetry of the situation at hand.
2	54		As a rule of thumb, we choose a surface such that the electric field is the same (and possibly zero) everywhere along as many regions of the surface as possible, because such a choice makes it easy to determine the field line flux through the surface.
0	54		Consider, for example, the charged particle shown in Figure 24.12a.
0	54		As we have seen, the field lines for the particle radiate outward from it.
0	54		(The figure shows only a two-dimensional cross section of the three-dimensional situation.)
0	54		The field is symmetrical in all three dimensions- it has the same magnitude at the same distance from the center in any direction.
1	54		Therefore, if we draw a spherical Gaussian surface that is concentric with the particle, the magnitude of the electric field is the same at all locations on the sphere.
1	54		In other words, the field line density is the same all over the surface of the sphere.
1	54		As we have seen in the preceding section, the field line flux through the Gaussian surface is proportional to the charge enclosed by the sphere.
1	54		Now suppose we replace the charged particle by a spherical shell that carries the same charge as the particle and still fits within our Gaussian surface (Figure 24.12b).
1	54		If the charge is uniformly distributed over the shell, then the electric field should still be the same in all directions.
1	54		Like the charged particle, the charged shell has spherical symmetry (see the box "Symmetry and Gauss's law" on page 647): Reorienting the spherical shell by rotating it over an angle about any axis does not change the charge configuration and so should not change the electric field at a given location.
0	54		This means that the field lines should again be straight lines radiating uniformly outward.
0	54		Also, the field line flux through the Gaussian surface should still be the same because the surface encloses the same amount of charge.
1	54		The only way that the field line fluxes through the Gaussian surfaces in Figures 24.12a and b can be uniform and equal in magnitude is if the electric fields are the same at every position on the spherical Gaussian surface.
3	54		Because this argument holds for a spherical Gaussian surface of any radius, we can conclude: The electric field outside a uniformly charged spherical shell is the same as the electric field due to a particle that carries an equal charge located at the center of the shell.
3	54		This means that a uniformly charged shell exerts a electric force on a charged particle outside the shell as if all the shell's charge were concentrated at the center of the shell.
2	54		Because a sphere may be viewed as a collection of shells, we can extend this statement to uniformly charged spheres.
0	54		Let us now turn our attention to the electric field in the space enclosed by the shell.
0	54		We draw a spherical Gaussian surface that fits within the shell (Figure 24.12c).
0	54		This Gaussian surface encloses no charge, so the field line flux through the Gaussian surface is zero.
0	54		Because the electric field can only be radially outward by symmetry, the electric field must be zero everywhere on the Gaussian surface.
3	54		Because we can vary the radius of the Gaussian surface from zero to the inner radius of the shell without changing this argument, we find: In the absence of other charged objects, the electric field in the space enclosed by a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero everywhere in the enclosed space.
0	54	FIG	Figure 24.12 Using spherical Gaussian surfaces to examine the electric fields of a charged particle and a  uniformly charged spherical shell.
0	54	FIG	The electric fields, Gaussian surfaces, and charged shell are spherical and  are shown here in cross section.
4	55	SM	Physically this means that a uniformly charged shell exerts no electric force on a charged particle located inside the shell.
0	55	SM	24.11  There are two reasons the field line flux through a closed surface may be zero: because the field is zero everywhere or because the outward flux is balanced by an equal inward flux.
0	55	SM	Why can't the latter situation be true for the Gaussian surface in Figure 24.12c? 
1	55		Particles, shells, and spheres are the only objects that exhibit spherical symmetry.
0	55		Figure 24.14 illustrates a different type of symmetry: the cylindrical symmetry of an infinitely long, uniformly charged straight wire.
1	55		* Because of this symmetry, rotating the wire about its axis or moving it along the axis should not have any effect on the electric field at any position in space.
1	55		For this to be the case, the field lines must be arranged radially along planes that are perpendicular to the wire (Figure 24.14).
0	55		We can take advantage of this symmetry by drawing a Gaussian surface in the shape of a cylinder that is concentric with the wire, as shown in Figure 24.14.
0	55		The symmetry of an object is determined by its symmetry operations-manipulations that leave its appearance unchanged (see Section 1.2).
0	55		A sphere, for example, looks the same if we reorient it by rotating it about any axis ( Figure 24.13a).
0	55		This type of symmetry is called spherical symmetry.
0	55		An infinitely long, cylindrical rod does not look any different if we rotate it, reverse it, or translate it about its long axis (Figure 24.13b).
0	55		The rod is said to have cylindrical symmetry.
0	55		An infinite flat sheet has planar symmetry: It remains unchanged if it is rotated about an axis perpendicular to the sheet or translated along either of the two axes perpendicular to this axis (Figure 24.13c).

0	55	SM	24.12  Consider a point on the curved part of the Gaussian surface in Figure 24.14.
0	55	SM	Does the magnitude of the electric field at that point increase, decrease, or stay the same if you (a) change the location of the point on the curved surface or (b) increase the radius of the Gaussian surface?
0	55	SM	(c) What is the field line flux through the left and right surfaces of the Gaussian surface? 
0	55		We can use the cylindrical Gaussian surface to find how the electric field due to the charged wire decreases with Many other types of symmetry may occur, but these three types play an important role in electrostatics.
0	55		For charge configurations that exhibit any of these three symmetries, we can calculate the electric field due to the charge distribution directly using Gauss's law.
1	55		Because objects are never infinite, they cannot exhibit true cylindrical or planar symmetry.
0	55		However, for a long straight wire or a large flat sheet we can often obtain good results by assuming they have cylindrical or planar symmetry.

0	56		distance from the wire.
0	56		As you can see from the figure, the field line flux through the curved surface of the cylinder is independent of its radius r. No matter how large we make the radius of the cylinder, the same number of field lines pass through it.
0	56		The area A of the curved surface is equal to the perimeter times the height h of the cylinder: A = 2prh.
1	56		As we increase the radius r of the cylinder, the surface area increases proportionally to r, and so the field line density must decrease as 1>r to maintain a constant number of field lines.
1	56		Because the field line density is a measure of the electric field strength, this means that the electric field due to the wire decreases as 1>r, as we established in Example 23.4.
0	56		A quantitative expression for the electric field due to a charged rod is given in Section 24.8.
1	56		Figure 24.15 shows a situation with a different symmetry: a charged sheet.
1	56		If the sheet is very large and the charge is uniformly distributed along it, then the electric field lines must be perpendicular to the sheet and also uniformly distributed along it.
0	56		The one-dimensional symmetry exhibited by the electric field due to the charged sheet is an example of planar symmetry.
0	56		To take advantage of this symmetry, we draw a cylindrical Gaussian surface that straddles the sheet, as illustrated in Figure 24.15. 
0	56	SM	24.13 Consider a point on the right surface of the Gaussian surface in Figure 24.15.
0	56	SM	Does the magnitude of the electric field at that point increase, decrease, or stay the same if you (a) change the location of the point on the right surface, or (b) increase the height h of the Gaussian surface?
0	56	SM	(c) Is the field line flux through the right surface of the Gaussian surface positive, negative, or zero?
0	56	SM	(d) How does the field line flux through the right surface compare to that through the left surface?
0	56	SM	(e) Is the field line flux through the curved surface of the Gaussian surface positive, negative, or zero? 
0	56		Because the area of the right surface and the field line flux through that surface don't change as we change the height of the cylinder, we conclude that the electric field line density doesn't change with distance to the plane.
1	56		Hence the magnitude of the electric field due to the charged sheet is the same everywhere (see also Example 23.6). 
0	56	H1	24.5 Charged conducting objects 
0	56		Let as now apply the relationship between field line flux and enclosed charge to charged conducting objects.
0	56		As we saw in Chapter 22, conducting materials permit the free flow of charge carriers within the bulk of the material.
0	56		Conducting objects typically contain many charge carriers that are free to move, such as electrons (in a metal) or ions (in a liquid conductor).
0	56		The material as a whole can still be electrically neutral; a neutral piece of metal, for example, contains as many positively charged protons as negatively charged electrons.
0	56		A consequence of this free motion of charged particles within a conducting object is that the particles always arrange themselves in such a way as to make the electric field inside the bulk of the object zero.
0	56		To see how this comes about, consider a free electron in a slab of metal.
0	56		If no field is present, no electric force is exerted on the electron.
1	56		If we apply an external field, however, the free electron is subject to a force in a direction opposite the direction of the electric field (opposite because of the negative charge of the electron).
1	56		In a similar way, all the free electrons in a slab of metal initially accelerate in a direction opposite the direction of an applied field ( Figure 24.16).
1	56		This leaves behind a positive charge on one side of the slab and creates a negative charge on the opposite side.
1	56		Because of this rearrangement of charge, an induced electric field builds up in a direction opposite the direction of the external field.
1	56		As a result, the electric field inside the slab, which is the sum of the external electric field and the induced electric field, decreases.
0	56		As this field decreases, so does the force exerted on the free electrons in the slab.
1	56		When enough charge carriers have accumulated on each side of the slab to make the electric field inside the slab zero, the electric force exerted on the free electrons in the metal becomes zero and the material reaches electrostatic equilibrium-the condition in which the distribution of charge in a system does not change.
0	56		The time interval it takes for a metal to reach electrostatic equilibrium is very short (about 10-16 s ), so the rearrangement of charge carriers is virtually instantaneous.
2	56		The important point to remember is: The electric field inside a conducting object that is in electrostatic equilibrium is zero.
0	56		Keep in mind that this statement holds only in electrostatic equilibrium.
1	56		When charge carriers are made to flow through a conducting object-as in any electric or electronic device, like your stereo or a refrigerator-the electric field is not zero inside the object!
0	56		Suppose now we add charge to a conducting object.
1	56	FIG	Figure 24.15 The electric field of a uniformly charged sheet exhibits planar symmetry.
1	56	FIG	We examine its field by drawing a cylindrical Gaussian surface that straddles the sheet.
0	57		It makes sense to assume that the charged particles will arrange themselves over the object in such a way as to spread out as far as possible from one another, given that particles carrying like charges repel.
0	57		We can use a Gaussian surface to obtain a better understanding of where the charged particles go. 
0	57	SM	24.14 Consider a spherical Gaussian surface inside a positively charged conducting object that has reached electrostatic equilibrium.
0	57	SM	(a) Is the field line flux through the Gaussian surface positive, negative, or zero?
0	57	SM	(b) What can you conclude from your answer to part a about the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface? 
0	57		We can extend the result of Checkpoint 24.14 to conducting objects of any shape.
1	57		Consider, for example, the irregularly shaped, charged conducting object shown in Figure 24.17.
0	57		Draw a Gaussian surface of the same shape as the object, just below its surface.
1	57		Given that the field is zero everywhere inside the conducting object, the field line flux through the Gaussian surface is zero and the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface is also zero.
2	57		Because we can choose the Gaussian surface arbitrarily close to the surface of the object, we conclude: Any surplus charge placed on an isolated conducting object arranges itself at the surface of the object.
2	57		No surplus charge remains in the body of the conducting object once it has reached electrostatic equilibrium.

0	58	SM	Because the field line flux through this surface is zero, the charge enclosed by the surface must be zero.
0	58	SM	There is charge +q inside the surface (in the charged particle), however, and so in order for the charge enclosed by the surface to be zero, a quantity of charge - q must have migrated from someplace in the region surrounding the cavity and accumulated on the inner cavity surface.
0	58	SM	Because the sphere is electrically neutral, the charge - q that migrated to the inner cavity surface must leave a charge +q behind somewhere else on the sphere.
0	58	SM	If I now draw Gaussian surface 2 just inside the sphere's outer surface (Figure 24.18c), I see that, because the field line flux through this Gaussian surface has to be zero, the charge enclosed by this surface is also zero.
0	58	SM	The positive charge +q that results from the migration of charge - q to the cavity surface must therefore reside outside Gaussian surface 2.

0	58	SM	Therefore all the field lines that start on the charged particle must end on the negative charge at the cavity surface.
0	58	SM	In order for all the field lines to end here, the quantity of negative charge on the cavity surface must be equal to the quantity of charge on the particle.
0	58	SM	The sphere is electrically neutral, and my choice for where I draw Gaussian surface 2 requires that all the positive charge resulting from the migration of negative charge to the cavity surface must accumulate outside Gaussian surface 2, which means right at the sphere's outer surface.

0	58		That the electric field inside any conductor is zero in electrostatic equilibrium allows us to draw one additional important conclusion.
3	58		Because the electric fields must be zero everywhere, including at the surface of a conducting object, there cannot be any component of the electric field parallel to the surface of the object, and therefore we can conclude: In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field at the surface of a conducting object is perpendicular to that surface.
1	58		If there were a component of the electric field parallel to the surface, that component would cause any free charge carrier to move along the surface, which means the conductor is not in electrostatic equilibrium.

0	59	SM	Even though C is not on a field line, the field line density, which is represented by the spacing of the field lines around point C, is nonzero.
0	59	SM	4.
0	59	SM	Because electric field lines converge on one point near the top of the area enclosed by the surface and diverge from a point near the bottom, there must be objects that carry both negative and positive charges inside the surface.

0	60	H1	24.6 Electric flux 
0	60		We introduced two important concepts in the first part of this chapter: the field line density, which is proportional to the strength of the electric field, and the field line flux, which represents the number of field lines going outward through a closed surface minus the number of field lines going inward.
0	60		In this section we'll turn these concepts into quantities we can calculate.
0	60		Consider, for example, a trapezoidal box in a uniform electric field ( Figure 24.22a).
0	60		The field line flux through the closed surface of the trapezoidal box is zero: Twenty field lines go into the back surface and 20 come out through the front surface.
0	60		Another way of putting this is to say that the field line flux into the rear surface is equal in magnitude to the field line flux out of the front surface.
0	60		Instead of using field lines, however, whose number is chosen arbitrarily, we'll work with a quantity called the electric  ux, represented by the symbol ( is the Greek capital phi).
0	60		The magnitude of the electric flux through a surface with area A in a uniform electric field of magnitude E is defined aswhere u is the angle between the electric field and the normal to the surface. 
0	60	SM	24.17 (a) Consider the front surface of the trapezoidal box in Figure 24.22a, detached from the rest of the trapezoidal box.
0	60	SM	Does the field line flux through that surface increase, decrease, or stay the same if any of the following quantities is increased: (i) the area of the front surface, (ii) the magnitude of the electric field (keeping the area constant), (iii) the slope of the front surface (that is to say, the angle between the surface and the direction of the electric field is increased)?
0	60	SM	(b) Does the electric flux through the front surface increase, decrease, or stay the same if any of these quantities is changed? 
0	60		As Checkpoint 24.17 shows, electric flux, as we've defined it in Eq.
0	60		24.1, behaves like the field line flux.
0	60		To make the correspondence more precise, we define  an  area vector equal to the surface area A and whose direction is normal to the plane of the area.
0	60		On closed surfaces we choose faces later).
0	60		Figure 24.22b shows the area vectors associated with the front and back surfaces of the (closed) trapezoidal box.
0	60		With this definition, Eq.
0	60		24.1 can be written as a scalar product (Eq.
0	60		10.33):EK EA cos = ES#ASwhere u is the angle between electric flux is N#m2>C.

0	60	SM	(b) What are the electric fluxes through the front and back surfaces? 
0	60		The above definition of electric flux applies only for uniform electric fields and flat surfaces.
0	60		Let us therefore consider the more general case of an irregular surface in a nonuniform field ( through that surface, we divide the entire surface into small segments of surface area dAi, with each segment being small enough that we can consider it to be essentially flat, and we can define an area vector d to the surface area dAi ment.

1	60	FIG	For very small segments, each segment is essentially flat and the field through each segment is essentially uniform.
1	60	FIG	The flux through the entire surface is then given by the sum of all of the contributions through each segment.

0	61		(24.3) If we let the area of each segment approach zero, then the number of segments approaches infinity and the sum is replaced by an integral:  E= limdAiS0gESi#dASi=3ES#dAS The integral in Eq.
0	61		24.4 is called a surface integral; dAS infinitesimally small surface segment.
0	61		If the surface is closed, this surface inte-gral is written as  E=CES#dAS, (24.5) where the circle through the integral sign indicates that the integration is to be taken over the entire closed surface and dAS is chosen to point outward.

0	62	H1	24.7 Deriving Gauss's Law 
0	62		Checkpoint 24.19 shows that the electric flux through a spherical Gaussian surface is equal to the charge q enclosed by the sphere times k = 9.0  109 N#m2>C2 lomb's law (see Eqs.
0	62		22.1 and 22.5).
0	62		This relationship is usually written in the form  where P0 is called the electric constant:  P014pk># Equation 24.6 is a special case of Gauss's law, which states that the electric flux through the closed surface of an arbitrary volume is  where qenc is the enclosed charge-the sum of all charge on an object or portion of an object enclosed by the closed surface.
0	62		The formal proof of Gauss's law is an extension of the calculation you performed in Checkpoint 24.19 and is shown in the box "Electric flux though an arbitrary closed surface".
0	62		Gauss's law is a direct consequence of Coulomb's law with its dence and the superposition of electric fields.
0	62		In that respect, it contains nothing new.
0	62		However, as the next section shows, Gauss's law greatly simplifies the calculation of electric fields due to charge distributions that exhibit one of the three symmetries we discussed in Section 24.4.

0	62	H2	 
0	62	H3	evaluate reSult Because there is no charge enclosed by 
0	62	SM	the Gaussian surface, I know that the field line flux through the surface must be zero, a fact I confirm by looking at Figure 24.24: The four field lines shown contribute a flux of - 4 on the back flat surface, +4 on the front flat surface, and 0 along the curved surface, for a total of - 4 + 4 + 0 = 0.
0	63		It therefore makes sense that the electric flux through this Gaussian surface also is zero.
0	63		Consider a particle that carries a positive charge +q, surrounded by the irregularly shaped closed surface shown in Figure 24.26a.1.
0	63		1.
0	63		To find the electric flux through the irregular surface, we divide the volume enclosed by the surface into small square wedges that taper to a point at the charged particle, one of which is shown.
0	63		We calculate the electric flux through the surface segment dA cut out by each wedge and then sum the contributions from all the wedges.2.
0	63		2.
0	63		To determine the electric flux through dA in Figure 24.26a, we draw two spherical Gaussian surfaces around  q: one with a radius r1 equal to the distance between dA and q, the other with an arbitrary radius r2.
0	63		Our wedge from step 1 now defines two other small surface segments dA1 and dA2 on these two spheres.
0	63		3.
0	63		If the segment dA is made very small, then the field lines in the wedge are nearly parallel to one another.
0	63		Therefore, according to what we found in Section 24.6, the electric flux through dA is equal to that through dA1 (Figure 24.26b).
0	63		In addition, as you showed in Checkpoint 24.19, this flux is also equal to that through surface segment dA2.
0	63		In fact, the electric flux is the same through any surface that cuts through the wedge.
0	63		Put differently, any surface that cuts through the wedge intercepts the same number of field lines.
0	63		Electric flux through an arbitrary closed surface 4.
0	63		We can repeat this procedure for each wedge.
0	63		Each time, we find that the electric flux through a segment dA on the irregular surface is equal to that through a corre-sponding segment dA2.
0	63		As we add the contributions of all the wedges, we find that the electric flux through the closed irregular surface is equal to that through a sphere of arbitrary radius r centered on q.
0	63		5.
0	63		If there is more than one charged particle inside the irregularly shaped surface, we can use the above arguments for each particle individually and then use the superposition of electric fields (Section 23.3):ES= gESi, where ESi is the electric field due to particle i alone.
0	63		The electric flux due to all charged particles is then the sum of the electric fluxes due to the individual electric fields:E=gEi=gqiP0=qencP0.

0	64	SM	(Hint: Draw a small wedge from  q through the surface and determine the electric flux through the two intersections between the wedge and the surface.)
0	64	H1	24.8 Applying Gauss's Law 
0	64		Gauss's law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed by it.
0	64		In Section 24.5 we encountered one important application of Gauss's law: If we can choose a Gaussian surface such that the electric field is zero everywhere on that surface (inside a conducting material, for example), then we know that the charge enclosed by that surface must be zero.
0	64		In this section we show how Gauss's law can be used to avoid having to carry out any integrations to calculate the electric field.
0	64		In principle one can calculate the electric flux through any surface, but the calculation is not trivial in general.
0	64		For the surfaces and charged objects shown in Section 24.4 and summarized in the electric flux is easy to calculate because the field lines are either parallel to the surface (in which case the electric flux is zero) or perpendicular to it and the magnitude of the electric field is constant (in which case the electric flux is simply the product of the magnitude of the electric field E and the surface area A).
0	64		To see the benefit of Gauss's law, consider a charged spherical shell of radius R that carries a uniformly distributed positive charge q.
0	64		The electric field due to this charged shell can be calculated using the procedure outlined in Section 23.7: Divide the shell into infinitesimally small segments that carry a charge dq, apply Coulomb's law to each small segment, and integrate over the entire shell (Eq.
2	64		23.15): E Figure 24.27, however, SsP = k 3dqsrsP2rnsP .
0	64	FIG	Figure 24.27 Applying Gauss's law to determine the electric fields of symmetrical charge distributions.
0	65		(24.9) As you may imagine, this so-called direct integration is no simple matter (see Section 13.8 for a similar integral), even though the result, which we derived qualitatively in Section 24.4, is surprisingly simple.
0	65		Taking advantage of the symmetry of the problem, however, we can use Gauss's law to find the answer in just two steps.
0	65		We begin by drawing a concentric spherical Gaussian surface of radius around the shell ( Figure 24.28a).
0	65		According to Gauss's law, the flux through the Gaussian surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by E=q encP0=qP0.
0	65		(24.10) In addition, we know that because of the spherical symmetry the electric field has the same magnitude E at each position on the Gaussian surface and the field is perpendicular to the surface.
0	65		Because the electric field is perpendicular, we have ES#dAS= E dA, and because E has the same value everywhere on the Gaussian surface, we can pull the electric field out of the integral in Eq.
1	65		24.5:  E=CES#dAS=C E dA = E CdA = EA, (24.11) where A is the area of the spherical Gaussian surface:A = 4pr2.
0	65		(24.12) Substituting Eq.
0	65		24.12 into Eq.
0	65		24.11, we obtainE= 4pr2E.
0	65		(24.13) Combining Eqs.
0	65		24.10 and 24.13, we obtain4pr2E =qP0 (24.14)or E =14pP0qr2= k qr2.
0	65		(24.15) This is exactly the magnitude of the electric field due to a particle carrying a charge q located at the center of the shell, as we concluded in Example 23.7 for a solid sphere.
0	65		We can also use Gauss's law to determine the electric field inside the shell by drawing a concentric spherical Gaussian surface with radius (Figure 24.28b).
0	65		For this surface the enclosed charge is zero, right side of Eq.
0	65		24.14 becomes zero.
0	65		Consequently, the electric field inside the uniformly charged spherical shell must be zero.
0	65		Note that our calculation did not involve working out any integrals, even though Eq.
0	65		24.5 does contain an integral-the symmetry of the problem allows us to bypass the integration.
0	65		The procedure box on page 658 shows how to calculate the electric field using Gauss's law for charge distributions that exhibit one of the symmetries listed in Figure 24.27.
0	65		In the next three exercises we apply this procedure to calculate the electric field of a number of different charge distributions.

0	67	SM	Can you use Gauss's law to derive this expression as well?
0	67	SM	Why or why not?
0	67	SM	What is the electric field magnitude a radial distance r from the central length axis of an infinitely long thin rod carrying a positive charge per unit length l? 
0	67	H3	Solution  An infinitely long rod has cylindrical symmetry. 
0	67	SM	I assume the rod's diameter is vanishingly small.
0	67	SM	From the symmetry, I know that the electric field points radially outward (see Section 24.4).
0	67	SM	I therefore make a sketch showing the rod and a few representative field lines.
0	67	SM	I then draw a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius r and height h around the rod (Figure 24.30).
0	67	SM	The cylinder encloses a length h of the rod, so the enclosed charge isqenc=lh.

0	67	H2	Exercise 24.8 Electric field of an infinite charged sheet 
0	67	SM	What is the electric field a distance d from a thin, infinite nonconducting sheet with a uniform positive surface charge density s? 
0	67	H3	Solution  An infinite sheet has planar symmetry.
0	67	H3	From the 
0	67	SM	symmetry I know that the electric field points away from the sheet and that the magnitude of the electric field is the same everywhere (see Section 24.4).
0	67	SM	I make a sketch of the sheet and the electric field and then draw a Gaussian surface in the form of a cylinder that straddles the sheet (Figure 24.31).
0	67	SM	If the cross section of the cylinder has area A, then the cylinder encloses a piece of the sheet of area A and the enclosed charge isqenc= sA.
0	67	SM	(1) The electric flux through the top and bottom faces of the Gaussian surface is zero because the electric field is parallel to those faces.
0	67	SM	I also know that symmetry requires the electric field to have the same magnitude E at each position on the cylindrical part of the surface.
0	67	SM	I can therefore pull the electric field out of the integral.
0	67	SM	The electric flux through that part of the surface isE=3ES#dAS=3EdA = E3dA.

0	67	SM	1 and 3 into Eq.
0	67	SM	24.8, I obtainE(2prh) =lhP0or  E =l2pP0r=2klr.
0	67	SM	<CHECK> This is the same result I obtained by direct integration in Example 23.4 for a finite charged rod in the limit that I am close to the rod (which makes the rod appear infinitely long).
0	68	SM	The direct integration, however, took almost two pages of work!Figure 24.31 The electric flux through the cylindrical part of the Gaussian surface is zero because the field lines are parallel to that surface.
0	68	SM	The field is perpendicular to the two ends and points outward, however, so the electric flux through those ends is the product of the area of each end, A, and the magnitude of the electric field:E= 2EA.
0	68	SM	(2) Substituting Eqs.
0	68	SM	1 and 2 into Eq.

0	68		The situation is a little different for a conducting plate.
0	68		Consider, for example, the infinite charged conducting plate shown in Section 24.5, any charge resides on the outside surfaces of the conducting object, so we have to consider the charge on both surfaces.
